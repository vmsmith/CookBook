### Spanish Garlic Chicken  

#### Ingredients

* Bone in chicken thighs
* Olive oil
* 5 – 6 heaping tablespoons of garlic
* 3 Bay leaves
* Crushed red pepper
* Dried oregano
* 1 package of Goya Sazon-Azafran 
* Spanish paprika
* 1 – 2 cups of dry white wine
* 1 cup chicken stock
* Fresh cilantro
* Fresh parsley
* A few squeezes of lemon juice

#### Preparation  
1. Peel and chop garlic  
2. Chop cilantro  
3. Chop parsley  
4. Cut lemon  

#### Directions

1. Brown each side of chicken and set aside. 

2. Add some olive oil if chicken fat hasn't created enough fat in the pan.

3. Add garlic and cook until just getting brown. 

4. Add bay leaves, crushed red pepper, dried oregano/cilantro, Sazon-Azafran, and Spanish paprika. 

5. Stir ingredients through and cook for 1-2 minutes at a lower heat so you don't risk burning garlic.

6. Add white wine and chicken stock. 

7. Add chicken back to the sauce and cook covered for 90 minutes or more at low heat while occasionally flipping the chicken over. Cook it very low and slow so the chicken is falling off the bone. 

8. Towards the end cook for 15 minutes with lid off to allow the sauce to reduce a bit. 

9. Finish with fresh cilantro and parsley and a squeeze of lemon juice. 

10. Serve it with either rice or homemade Spanish style potato chips.
