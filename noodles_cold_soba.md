### Zaru Soba - Cold Soba Noodles    

#### Ingredients   
* 200 grams dried soba noodles (for 2 servings)
* Mentsuyu dipping sauce   
* 1 raw quail egg   
* Strips of nori (dried seaweed), cut finely
* 1 teaspoon of wasabi
* Scallions, finely sliced
* Grated daikon (optional)
* Toasted sesame seeds (optional)
* Shichimi togarashi (optional for heat)

#### Preparation     
1. Crack the quail egg(s) into small ramekin bowls
2. Slice the nori into think strips
3. Slice the scallions
4. Grate the daikon
5. Toast the sesame seeds
6. Chill the Mentsuyu sauce   


#### Directions   
1. Bring a large pot of unsalted water to a boil.    
2. Add soba and cook according to package (usually 5–7 minutes).
3. Drain, then rinse thoroughly under cold running water to stop cooking and remove starch.
4. Chill in an ice bath for a minute or two, then drain well.
5. Place the cold soba on a bamboo tray (or shallow dish).  
6. Pour the chilled mentsuyu into bowls.
7. Add the quail egg, nori, and any other toppings to the sauce.

#### Mentsuyu Dipping Sauce   
* 3 Tbsp Soy Sauce    
* * 3 Tbsp Sake   
* 3 Tbsp Mirin    
* 1/2 cup Katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes)    
* 2/3 cup water (cold)

1. In a pot, combine Soy Sauce, Sake, and Mirin and cook at medium heat.
2. Add Katsuobushi dried bonito flakes.
3. Let boil for a minute, remove from heat, and cool in the pot.
4. Strain Katsuobushi.
5. Mix the sauce with water.   

#### Beverages   
1. Cold Green Tea (Reich) 

Sencha – Bright and grassy, perfect chilled.
Hojicha – Roasted green tea, nutty and low in caffeine.
Genmaicha – Green tea with roasted brown rice; toasty and very comforting.

Chill it ahead of time, or serve over ice. No sugar needed.

2. Cold Sake (Reishu)

Junmai Ginjo or Junmai Daiginjo – Clean, lightly aromatic, and often served chilled.


3. Mugicha (Barley Tea)
Why it works: A staple summer drink in Japan, it’s naturally caffeine-free, toasty, and pairs well with cold soba dishes.

Flavor profile: Slightly nutty, mild bitterness, extremely refreshing when served cold.

Available in teabags at Asian groceries; just steep and chill.

4. Sparkling Water with a Japanese Citrus Twist
Not traditional per se, but adding a splash of yuzu juice or sudachi to sparkling water is a very Japanese-style refreshment and pairs beautifully with the meal.

5. Japanese Beer (if you want something with alcohol)
Why it works: Crisp and cold, light lagers like Asahi, Sapporo, or Kirin don't overwhelm the palate.

Best served very cold, in small glasses as the Japanese do.
