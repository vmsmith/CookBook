### Parsley  

#### Keeping Fresh  

1. Trim the stems slightly, and without washing place the bundle in a container filled with about 1 inch of water.  
2. Cover the container loosely with a plastic bag and store in the refrigerator.  
3. Change the water every couple of days or when it looks murky.  
4. Rinse the stems and leaves as needed and pat dry in paper towels.

#### Keeping Frozen  

1. Wash and dry the leaves and place them in ice cube trays.  
2. Cover gently with water or olive oil.  
3. Once it’s frozen store in freezer containers.  
4. This is great for use in soups or sauces, but not suitable for garnish as the leaves will turn limp.  

#### Uses
