* 2 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes
* 2 cups heavy cream
* 2 cups whole milk
* 8 ounces Gruyère cheese
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* 2 dried bay leaves

#### Directions   
1. Place the potatoes into a large pot with the minced garlic, heavy cream, whole milk, salt, black pepper, nutmeg, and bay leaves.

4. Using a slotted spoon, transfer half of the potatoes into the prepared baking dish and arrange in an even layer.
5. Top with half of the grated cheese.
6. Arrange the remaining potatoes on top of cheese in an even layer.
7. Pour about 2 cups of the cream mixture over the potatoes, stopping just below the top layer. (Do not use all of the cream mixture.)
8. Top with the remaining cheese.
9. Bake until the potatoes are golden brown and easily pierced with a knife all the way to the bottom of the baking dish, 40 to 45 minutes.
