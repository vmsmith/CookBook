### Lamb Brains   

Rainsy's recipe   

#### Ingredients   
* Lamb brains   
* Vinegar   
* Fresh parsley   
* Salt and pepper

#### Preparation   
1. Soak the raw brains in vinegar water (10 to 20% vinegar) for 15 - 20 minutes.   
2. Wash the brains in fresh water and drain.
3. Chop the parsley.  

#### Directions   
1. Heat a frying pan to a fairly high temperature (8 on a scale of 0 to 10) after putting in a good amount of olive oil. 
2. Put the brains on one side for 10 to 15 minutes until golden brown (but not too dark).
3. Turn the brains over to cook the other side after lowering the heat from 8 to 7.
4. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes until the second side is cooked to the same degree.
5. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and chopped fresh parsley.
6. Put a little bit of soft butter on the brains at the very end and wait until it is liquid in the pan.
7. Serve immediately.
