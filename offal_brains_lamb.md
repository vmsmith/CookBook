### Fried Breaded Lamb Brains   

#### Ingredients   
* Lambs’ brains   
* Sea salt    
* 1 egg, lightly beaten    
* 1 cup plain flour seasoned with salt & pepper    
* Vegetable oil for deep-frying    

#### Preparation   
1. Soak the lambs’ brains in a large bowl of cold water for 1-2 hours to remove the excess blood.   
2. Carefully separate the lobes by removing the white central cortex in the middle.


#### Directions   
1. Bring a large pot of water to the boil and season it with some sea salt.
2. Use a slotted spoon to carefully poach the brains in the simmering water for 3-5 minutes. You don’t want to cook it completely, but just long enough for the brains to firm up and become easier to handle.   
3. Use a slotted spoon to remove the brains to a plate lined with kitchen paper and allow to cool.   
4. Fill a large pan with enough vegetable oil for deep-frying (about 5cm or 2 inch depth) and heat to about 180°C (350°F).   
5. Dip the poached brains in the beaten egg and lightly coat with some flour.    
6. Deep-fry the brains in batches for about 5 minutes each, or until they turn lovely and golden.   
7. Drain on some kitchen paper and sprinkle over some sea salt flakes.   
8. Serve immediately.
