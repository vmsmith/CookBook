### Seafood Paella  

Classic seafood paella doesn't have much in the way of vegetable in it, usually it's served with either a cooked vegetable, or more often, a salad on the side.  

#### Ingredients  
* [Seafood stock]()  
* 4 large whole prawns  
* 2 small cuttlefish (sepia) if you can find them, if not, small squid - roughly 4-5" long bodies (options if you can't find that size - a handful of really small ones, the "chipirones/calamaretis", or 1 large one that we'll just cut in half) - all you really need is the body part, though if they come whole with tentacles, that's fine   
* 1 white fish fillet (enough to cut in two, one for each portion), ideally something like dorade, bream, or red snapper  
* 1 large clove garlic  
* 1 large roma/plum tomato, mashed up or pureed  
* 1/2 Tb sweet paprika  
* 1/3 tsp saffron threads  
* 160gm (5.6 oz, about 4/5 of a cup) of arroz bomba   

#### Preparation  

1. Shell and devein the prawns  
2. Cut the squid  
3. Cut the fish in two    
4. Mash the tomato
