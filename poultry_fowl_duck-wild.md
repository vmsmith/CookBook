### Roast Wild Duck  

#### Ingredients 
* 1 wild duck    
* Sea salt and black pepper   
* 1 tbsp oil
* 1 carrot, diced
* 1 leek, green part only, sliced
* 1 tsp juniper berries, crushed
* 2 bay leaves
* 100ml white wine

#### Preparation   
1. Generously sprinkle duck with sea salt, inside and out, rubbing the salt into the skin. Place on a plate, unwrapped, and leave in the fridge ideally for 24 hours or as long as you can (up to 48 hours).
2. Dice carrot
3. Slice leek
4. Crush juniper berries
5. Preheat oven to 475F / 240C   

#### Directions   

1. Scatter the diced vegetables in a roasting pan with the juniper berries and the bay leaves, pour in the wine and place in the oven while you brown the duck in a pan.

2. Heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan and, over a medium heat, brown the duck well on all sides.

3. Transfer the duck to the roasting pan and settle on the vegetable bed. Season the breast with black pepper and roast for 14-25 minutes depending on the size of the duck. If you have spent some time browning the duck, 10 minutes may be enough.

4. Take the tray with the duck out of the oven and remove the legs, cutting through the hip bone with poultry scissors.

5. Put the legs back in the pan to cook for a further 3 minutes. Leave the rest of the bird to rest in a warm place.

6. When the legs are ready (you might want to check with a digital probe, it should read 65 â€“ 70C inserted in the thickest part of the leg), let them rest for a few minutes with the duck crown, then carve the breast or just cut each in half and serve with the legs and some cooking juices.
