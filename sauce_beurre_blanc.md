### Beurre Blanc #1

#### Ingredients  

* 1/4 cup (59 ml) dry white wine
* 1/4 cup (59 ml) white-wine vinegar
* 2 tablespoons finely chopped shallot
* 1/3 cup (79 ml) heavy cream
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/8 teaspoon white pepper, or to taste
* 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, cut into tablespoon-size pieces and chilled  

#### Preparation  

* Chop shallot  

#### Directions  

1. Boil wine, vinegar, and shallot in a heavy saucepan over moderate heat until liquid is syrupy and reduced to 2 to 3 tablespoons, about 5 minutes.  

2. Add cream, salt, and white pepper and boil 1 minute.  

3. Reduce heat to moderately low and add a few tablespoons butter, whisking constantly.  

4. Add remaining butter a few pieces at a time, whisking constantly and adding new pieces before previous ones have completely liquefied (the sauce should maintain consistency of hollandaise), lifting pan from heat occasionally to cool mixture.  

5. Remove from heat, then season to taste with salt and pepper and pour sauce through a medium-mesh sieve into a sauceboat, pressing on and then discarding shallot.  

6. Serve immediately.

### Buerre Blanc #2

#### Ingredients  

* 1/4 pound (125 g.) unsalted butter
* 1 shallot
* 2 tablespoons of wine vinegar
* pinch of sea salt

#### Preparation  

* Mince the shallot finely  
* Cut butter into 8 - 10 pieces  

#### Directions  

1. Bring the vinegar and the shallot to a simmer in a nonreactive pot â€” enamel is good  

2. When the liquid has nearly evaporated, remove from heat and begin adding the butter, bit by bit, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon to make an unctuous sauce

3. Wait until each bit has melted before adding the next  

4. Add the salt.

5. When all the butter has been incorporated, pour the sauce through a sieve into a clean pot or bowl to remove the shallot  

6. To serve, drizzle a spoonful or two of warm sauce over each portion
