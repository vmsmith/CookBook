### Beurre Blanc  

#### Ingredients  

* 2 ounces of dry white wine
* 2 ounces of white-wine vinegar
* 2 ounces finely chopped shallot
* 4 ounces heavy cream
* Salt and white pepper to taste
* 1/2 pound of unsalted butter, cut into 1/8 inch cubes and chilled
* Potato or corn starch   

#### Preparation  
1. Chop shallot
2. Make slurry with the wine and starch   

#### Directions    
1. Boil wine, vinegar, and shallot in a heavy saucepan over moderate heat until liquid is syrupy and reduced to 2 to 3 tablespoons, about 5 minutes.   
2. Add cream, salt, and white pepper and boil 1 minute.   
3. Reduce heat to moderately low and add a few tablespoons butter, whisking constantly.   
4. Add remaining butter a few pieces at a time, whisking constantly and adding new pieces before previous ones have completely liquefied (the sauce should maintain consistency of hollandaise), lifting pan from heat occasionally to cool mixture.   
5. Remove from heat, then season to taste with salt and pepper and pour sauce through a medium-mesh sieve into a sauceboat, pressing on and then discarding shallot.   
6. Serve immediately.
