### Chicken and Peppers With Creamy Paprika Sauce    

#### Ingredients   
* 1 1/4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1/2-inch thick strips
* 2 medium red and/or orange or yellow bell peppers, cored and sliced into 1/4-inch-thick strips
* 1 large yellow onion (12 ounces), halved and thinly sliced
* 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
* 3/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth, plus more as needed
* 1/2 cup plain full-fat yogurt
* 3/4 teaspoon fine salt, divided
* 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided
* 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 2 tablespoons sweet paprika, preferably Hungarian
* 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 3 tablespoons lightly packed fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, chopped
* Cooked egg noodles, for serving (optional)

#### Preparation    



#### Directions   
Step 1
Put the chicken in a medium bowl, season with 1/4 teaspoon each of the salt and pepper and gently toss to combine.
Step 2
In a large, deep skillet with a lid or in a Dutch oven, over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil until shimmering. Add half of the chicken and cook, stirring once or twice, until browned but not cooked through, about 3 minutes total. Transfer to a plate, then repeat with the remaining chicken.
Step 3
Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil to the skillet. Add the onion and peppers and cook, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add a splash of water or broth to the pan if it seems dry. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until aromatic, about 1 minute.
Step 4
Return the chicken to the pan, along with any accumulated juices, then add the paprika, cayenne and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the broth, increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes.
Step 5
Remove from the heat and stir in the yogurt until incorporated. Serve garnished with parsley, over egg noodles, if desired.
