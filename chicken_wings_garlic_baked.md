### Garlic Chicken Wings  

#### Ingredients   

* Wings:  
  * ~24 or ~2 pounds separated wings  
  * 3 heads of garlic minced  
  * 1 pinch sugar, 1 pinch salt, 1 pinch pepper  
  * 1 cup hot sauce of choice, can substitute a vinegar brine  

* Sauce:
  * 1/2 stick of butter  
  * 2 tbsp gochuchang  
  * 1 large bottle hot sauce of choice (I used Melinda’s Habanero)  
  * Black pepper  
  * 2 large pinches of extra spicy dried chili powder blend (look for something naturally red/orange not brown)  

* Blue cheese dipping sauce:  
  * 1/2 cup Greek yogurt  
  * 1/2 cup sour cream  
  * Splash milk if needed  
  * Generous amount of blue cheese depending how thick you like it(contrary to the picture I like two c’s)  
  * heavy salt & pepper (pink peppercorns are fruity and yummy in this)  
  * spare herbs from the fridge (I used some dry)  


#### Preparation  

1. Marinate the wings in garlic, sugar, salt, pepper and 1 cup of vinegar or one cup of hot sauce overnight.  
2. Preheat convection oven to 350F. 

#### Directions  

1. Place on a rack over a cookie sheet and bake for at 350 degrees just until the fat has rendered and locked in the juices (they will look like you have boiled them for a few minutes, like the color pallet of a potato chip).  
2. Cook for 20 min at 425 degrees.  
3. Flip as needed and cook for another 20ish minutes.  
4. Broil for a minute if you like the burnt crispy garlic.
