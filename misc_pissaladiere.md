### Pissaladière   

#### Ingredients   
* 250g strong white bread flour
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 3g fast-action yeast
* 1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing
* 1kg onions
* 1 garlic clove
* 3 tbsp olive oil
* A knob of butter (optional)
* 1 sprig each fresh rosemary and thyme, plus 1 bay leaf (all optional)
* Salt
* About 10 anchovy fillets
* About 14 dry black olives
* Extra-virgin olive oil, to serve

#### Preparation   
1. Slice the onions
2. Peel and mince the garlic   

#### Directions   
1. Put a large, heavy-bottomed pan or pot for which you have a tight-fitting lid on a low heat, add the oil and butter.   
2. Add the onions, herbs (if using), garlic and a pinch of salt.
3. Stir to coat the onions with the oil, then clap on the lid and leave to cook, stirring occasionally, for about an hour, or until they’re very soft.
4. Meanwhile, stir the flour, salt and yeast in a large bowl, then add the oil and just enough water (probably a little under 150ml) to bring it together into a coherent, but not sticky or floury dough.
5.
