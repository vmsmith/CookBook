### Beouf Bourguignon à la Julia Child   

#### Ingredients   
* 6 ounces of bacon, roughly chopped
* 3 pounds of stewing meat
* 2 - 3 cups of stock
* 3 cups of red wine
* 2 large carrot, sliced
* Parnips or chervil root   
* 1 large white onion, sliced   
* 6 garlic cloves
* 12 small pearl onions
* 1 pound of small mushrooms (possibly quartered)
* 2 tablespoons of flour
* 2 tablespoons of tomato paste
* 2 tablespoons of butter
* 1 teaspoon of fresh thyme (chopped)   
* 2 Bay leaves
* 1 tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil
* Pinch coarse salt and freshly ground pepper
* 2 tablespoons of fresh parsley, chopped   

#### Preparation    
* Slice carrots
* Slice onion
* Cut up parsnip or chervil root
* Preheat oven to 450F


#### Directions - Day One   
1. Sautée the bacon and remove.   
2. Dry the beef with a few paper towels for better browning, then, in batches, sear the beef on all sides in the Dutch oven.
3. Set the beef aside with the bacon.
4. Add the sliced carrots, onions, and parsnip/chervil root to the pot and sauté them in fat until browned, about 3 minutes.
5. If there's any excess fat, drain it now.
6. Add the bacon and beef back to the pot.
7. Season with 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt and 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper then toss.
8. Sprinkle with flour and toss once more.
9. Place in the center of the oven for 4 minutes.
10. Remove pot from oven, toss the beef, and place back in the oven for 4 more minutes.
11. Remove the pot from the oven and reduce the heat to 325°F.
12. To the pot, add the wine and stock. The liquid should barely cover the meat and vegetables.
13. Add the tomato paste, garlic and thyme.
14. Bring to a light simmer on the stove, then cover and simmer in the lower part of the oven for 3 to 4 hours, or until the meat is easily pierced.
15. Check for moisture, and add more stock if necessary.
16. Remove, let cool, and refigerate overnight.   

#### Day Two - Part I
1. Reheat the pot of stew.
2. Bring 1 1/2 tablespoons butter and 2 teaspoons oil to a medium heat in a sauté pan.
3. Add the pearl onions and toss around in the fat until they've browned, 10 minutes.
4. Then stir in 1/2 cup beef stock, a small pinch of salt and pepper and the herb bouquet.
5. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the onions for about 40 minutes, until the liquid has evaporated, and the onions are tender.
6. Remove the onions and set aside.
7. Discard the herb bouquet and wipe out the skillet. Add the remaining butter and oil and bring to a medium heat.
8. Add the mushrooms and cook for about 5 minutes, shaking the pan to coat with the butter.

#### Day Two - Part II    
9. Place a colander over a large pot.
10. Drain the beef stew through the colander and into the pot.
11. Place the pot with the sauce over a medium heat and simmer for about 5 minutes, skimming any fat on top.
12. Pour the beef and vegetables back into the Dutch oven.
13. Add the pearl onions and mushrooms to the pot.
14. Pour the sauce over the beef mix and simmer an additional 3 to 5 minutes.
