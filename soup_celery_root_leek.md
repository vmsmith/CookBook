### Celery Root and Leek Soup  

#### Ingredients  

* One large celery root (about 3-pounds 1.5kg), peeled and cubed  
* 2 leeks, cleaned and chopped  
* 2 garlic cloves  
* 3 cups (750ml) chicken stock  
* 3 cups (750ml) water   
* 2 tablespoons butter  
* 2 tablespoons olive oil  
* Sea salt  
* 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly-ground white pepper    
* Scant 1/8 teaspoon piment d'Esplette     

#### Preparation  

1. Peel and cube the celery root  
2. Clean and chop the leeks  

#### Directions  

1. In a large pot, melt the butter with the olive oil  
2. Add the leeks and cook for about five minutes, stirring frequently     
3. Add the garlic cloves and season with salt, and continue to cook until the leeks and garlic are soft and translucent - if the pot begins to brown too much on the bottom as they cook, add another pat of butter or pour of olive oil  
4. Add the celery root and stock    
5. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a strong simmer   
6. Cook, with the lid to the pot ajar on top, until the celery root pieces are soft and easily pierced with a paring knife, about forty five minutes  
7. Add white pepper and chile powder
8. Let the soup cool a bit, then blend until smooth   
9. Taste, and season with additional salt and pepper if desired    
10. If the soup is too thick, thin it with water or stock  
11. Food mill it if necessary   

**Variations:** Celery root has a distinctive flavor, but don’t hesitate to experiment with adding other ingredients. Cubes of pear or apple could be cooked with the cubes of celery root and puréed, a dusting of nutmeg, or some tangy crème fraîche instead of the olive oil are all worthy additions.

If you’re feeling opulent, this soup lends itself very well to shaved truffles scattered over the top.
