#### Roast Goose with Breast Crown  

#### Preparation  

1. Take the goose out of the fridge 2 hrs before roasting.  
2. Heat oven to 150C.  
3. Remove the wings delicately (to make stock).  
4. Remove the legs, taking care to capture as much meat as possible and not mangle the skin/fat.
5. Separate the crown from the rest of the bird **taking care to leave as much skin on the side as possible (it shrinks)**.
