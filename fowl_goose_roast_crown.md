#### Roast Goose with Breast Crown  
Adapted from [Raymond's Roast Goose](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/raymonds-roast-goose)  

#### Preparation  

1. Take the goose out of the fridge 2 hrs before roasting.  
2. Heat oven to 150C.  
3. Remove the wings delicately (to make stock).  
4. Remove the legs, taking care to capture as much meat as possible and not mangle the skin/fat.
5. Separate the crown from the rest of the bird **taking care to leave as much skin on the side as possible (it shrinks)**.  

#### Directions  

1.  Place the goose legs, skin-side up, in the roasting pan.  
2.  Salt and (white) pepper the legs, then cover tightly with aluminum foil.  
3. Roast for an hour, then remove the foil.  
4. Turn the oven up to 230C.  
5. Salt and (white) pepper the crown, place the crown on the legs, and roast for 30 minutes.  
6. Reduce the oven to 150C.  
7. Continue roasting for another 30 minutes.  
8. Remove the crown, wrap it in foil, and let it rest for 30 minutes while the legs continue to cook.  
9. Slice and serve with [red wine and date sauce](https://github.com/vmsmith/CookBook/blob/master/sauce_red_wine_date.md).
