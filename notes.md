### Notes

#### Cuisse de Pintade

Brown the guinea fowl pieces in a pot with oil and a little salt over high heat.  
Reserve the meat and remove the fat from the pot without cleaning it.  
Remove the first skin from the onions and slice them.  
Fry your onions with the butter and salt in the casserole over medium/high heat for 3 minutes, taking care to stir regularly.  
Add the white wine, scrape the bottom of the casserole with a wooden spoon to collect all the cooking juices.  
Add a little water, cover the guinea fowl legs and continue cooking for 30 minutes.  
Serve one guinea fowl leg per plate with onions. Add salt and pepper to taste.
