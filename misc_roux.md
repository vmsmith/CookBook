### Roux   

#### Brown Roux

A roux is a thickener for gravy or stew. It's made by cooking equal amounts of flour and a fat (your choice of butter, vegetable oil, or meat fats). And it's not only the base of sauces, it can also serve as the binding ingredient, the "glue" of many recipes. 

The three types of roux--white, blond, and brown-- are determined by the length of cooking time and resulting color. White and blond roux are the source of creamy milk or light stock-based sauces, with butter used as the fat. Brown roux forms the base for rich meaty sauces and gravies, and can be made with butter or meat fats. A well-made roux balances two goals: to cook the roux long enough to eliminate the taste of raw flour, yet slowly enough so the starch can swell, enabling it to absorb, thus thicken, whatever liquid is added later. 

Used in many cuisines, the roux provides the base for several classic French sauces, such as Bechamel, Veloute, Mornay, and Espagnole. You create the varieties depending on what other ingredients that you add to the roux. It also thickens stew-like dishes, such as Creole Gumbo. Lastly, it serves as the binding agent for dishes like souffles and croquettes. 

For enough roux to thicken 2 cups (1/2 quart) of liquid: 

1-2 tablespoons (30-60 grams) each of flour and fat, unless you're using vegetable oil: in this case, use twice as much flour as fat. 

A one-quart saucepan: if you have it, choose one with a heavy bottom 

Traditionally, a wire whisk or a wooden spoon is used to stir the roux. A large metal spoon also works. Avoid using a plastic utensil, which might melt slightly into the roux. 

Be sure to have all your ingredients and utensils by the stove. Once you add the flour to the fat, you need to stir constantly or you'll risk burning the flour. And that means starting all over again. 

Heat the saucepan on low heat. When you add the fat the pan should warm the fat (or melt the butter) without burning it. Keeping a watchful eye on the stove - if you see the oil begin to smoke, throw it away and start again. Oil that overheats contains many toxic chemicals. It'll taste bad, too. 

The fat should begin to melt immediately. But if it sizzles wildly, lower the heat under the saucepan. Swirl the pan (lift it off the burner and move it in a circular motion, dipping each side of the pan up and down slightly. This will distribute the melted fat evenly around the bottom of the pan. 

From this point on, the saucepan requires your constant attention. No wandering off to refresh your drink! 

Sprinkle the flour over the bottom of the saucepan. 
Immediately stir the mixture briskly with a wire whisk (or whatever you've got); in a minute or two, the flour should begin to puff and swell slightly. 

Cook to achieve the desired colour: 

* White roux: barely beige; complete in no less than five minutes. 
* Blond roux: golden; usually complete in 10 minutes. 
* Brown roux: deep nut-brown; this roux is often cooked from 45 minutes to 1 hour and smells nutty and baked when it's done. Most chefs use clarified butter for brown roux.  [Note: Try this.]

Usually at this point you would start to make your gravy or sauce, using the roux.
