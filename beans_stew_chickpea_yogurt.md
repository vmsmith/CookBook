## Afghan Chickpea and Yogurt Stew   

#### Ingredients   
* 1 cup of dried chickpeas, soaked overnight     
* 1/2 cup plain full-fat Greek yogurt   
* 1 small tomato, very finely chopped     
* 2 or 3 garlic cloves, grated     
* 1 red onion, finely chopped    
* 1 fresh green chile (such as Thai or serrano), finely chopped, plus a few whole chiles for serving    
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil   
* 1 tablespoon ground coriander   
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin   
* 1 teaspoon ground turmeric   
* 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* Salt   
* Cilantro, for serving    
* Warmed flatbread or steamed basmati rice, for serving

#### Preparation   
1. Soak the chickpeas overnight
2. Chop the tomato
3. Grate the garlic cloves
4. Chop the red onion
5. Chop the green peppers   

#### Directions   
1. Add the finely grated garlic cloves directly into the yogurt in a bowl and season with salt. Stir to combine, then taste. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
2. In a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high. When the oil is shimmering, add the onion and chile and cook, stirring often, until the onion is translucent and golden at the edges, about 10 minutes. Add more oil if the pan looks dry.
3. Lower the heat slightly, then stir in the coriander, cumin, turmeric and black pepper and cook, stirring, until sizzling and fragrant, about a minute.
4. Stir in the tomato and 1 teaspoon salt.
5. Add the chickpeas and enough just to cover.
6. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover partially and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has reduced and thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. It will thicken further once you add the yogurt later.
7. Remove from the heat, taste and add more salt if needed.
8. Stir in 2 tablespoons of the reserved garlic yogurt. Taste and add more yogurt if desired.
9. Serve immediately, topped with the cilantro and alongside the remaining garlic yogurt, flatbread or rice and whole chiles to nibble on for extra heat.
