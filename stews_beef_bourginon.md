### Beef Bourginon  

#### Ingredients    
* 6 slices bacon, cut into lardons    
* 3 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil    
* 3 pounds stewing beef, cut into 2-inch chunks    
* 2 - 3 large carrot, sliced thickly (to hold up)   
* 1 - 2 parnips, sliced thickly (to hold up)       
* 1 large white onion, sliced    
* 1 pinch coarse salt and freshly ground pepper    
* 2 tablespoons Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour    
* 3 cups of good red burgundy       
* 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 cups beef stock    
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste    
* 2 cloves smashed garlic    
* 1/2 teaspoon thyme    
* 1 crumbled bay leaf    
* 18 to 24 small pearl onions    
* 3 1/2 tablespoons butter    
* 1 herb bouquet (4 sprigs parsley, 2 sprigs thyme, 1 bay leaf)    
* 1 pound fresh white mushrooms, quartered    
* Marrow bones   

#### Preparation Day One  
1. Prehat oven to 450F    
2. Slice carrots   
3. Slice parsnips   
4. Slice onion   
5. Smash garlic    

#### Directions Day One   

1. In a large Dutch oven, sauté the bacon in 1 tablespoon of oil for about 3 minutes, until it starts to lightly brown.   
2. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.    
3. Dry the beef with a few paper towels, then, in batches, sear the beef on all sides in the Dutch oven.   
4. Set aside with the bacon.  
5. Back in the pot, add the sliced carrots and onions; sauté in fat until browned, about 3 minutes. (If there's any excess fat, drain it now.)
6. Add the bacon and beef back to the pot.   
7. Season with 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt and 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper. Toss. Sprinkle with flour and toss once more. Place in the center of the oven for 4 minutes.    
8. Remove pot from oven; toss beef and place back in the oven for 4 more minutes. Remove the pot from the oven and **reduce the heat to 325°F**.
9. Add the wine and stock to the pot. The liquid should barely cover the meat and vegetables.   
10. Add the tomato paste, garlic and thyme.   
11. Bring to a light simmer on the stove, then cover and simmer in the lower part of the oven for 3 to 4 hours, or until the meat is easily pierced.   
12. **All this can be done a day ahead of time to let the flavors marry**   

#### Preparation Day Two  
1. Prep the mushrooms      
2. Prep the pearl onions  

#### Directions Day Two 

1. Reheat the stew.
2. Add the marrow bones.  
3. Bring 1 1/2 tablespoons butter and 2 teaspoons oil to a medium heat in a sauté pan.   
4. Add the pearl onions and toss around in the fat until they've browned, 10 minutes.   
5. Then stir in 1/2 cup beef stock, a small pinch of salt and pepper and the herb bouquet.   
6. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the onions for about 40 minutes, until the liquid has evaporated, and the onions are tender.      
7. Remove the onions and set aside.   
8. Discard the herb bouquet and wipe out the skillet. Add the remaining butter and oil and bring to a medium heat.   
9. Add the mushrooms and cook for about 5 minutes, shaking the pan to coat with the butter.    
10. Place a colander over a large pot. Drain the beef stew through the colander and into the pot.     
11. Place the pot with the sauce over a medium heat and simmer for about 5 minutes, skimming any fat on top.   
12. Pour the beef and vegetables back into the Dutch oven.   
13. Add the pearl onions and mushrooms to the pot.    
14. Pour the sauce over the beef mix and simmer an additional 3 to 5 minutes.
