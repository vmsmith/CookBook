### Slow-Roasted Pork Belly with Celeriac and Pear Mash  

#### Ingredients  

* 1½ kg pork belly, skin scored  
* 3 rosemary sprigs, leaves stripped  
* 2 tsp coarse sea salt crystals  
* 10 black peppercorns  
* Purple sprouting broccoli, steamed, to serve  
* 750g celeriac, cubed  
* 1 large potato, cubed  
* 2 ripe pears, peeled and cubed  
* 3 tbsp double cream  
* Large knob of butter  

#### Preparation  

1. Preheat over to 22C  
2. Score the pork skin    
3. Make rosemary salt by grinding rosemary leaves, salt, and pepper  
4. Peel and cube the celeriac  
5. Peel and cube the potatos  
6. Peel and cube the pears  


#### Directions  

1. Rub the rosemary salt all over the pork, making sure it gets into the cuts in the skin     
2. Sit the pork in a large roasting tin, ideally on a rack, and roast for 30 mins  
3. Reduce heat to 170C and roast for 1 1/2 more hours    
4. Turn oven back up to 220C and roast for 20-30 mins to crisp    
5. Leave to rest on a board for 10 mins before carving    

6. When the pork is nearly ready to come out, put the celeriac and potato in a large pan of water, bring to the boil and cook for 10 mins until just tender    
7. Add the pears and cook for 2 mins more    
8. Drain well, then mash until smooth – a mouli or potato ricer does this job best    
9. Beat in a splash of cream and some butter, and serve with the pork and broccoli
