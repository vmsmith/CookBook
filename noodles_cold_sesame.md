### Cold Sesame Noodles    

#### Ingredients   
* 1 pound noodles, frozen or (preferably) fresh    
* 2 tablespoons sesame oil, plus a splash     
* 3 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce     
* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar    
* 2 tablespoons sesame paste (preferably Chinese)    
* 1 tablespoon smooth peanut butter    
* 1 tablespoon granulated sugar    
* 1 tablespoon finely grated ginger    
* 2 teaspoons minced garlic    
* 2 teaspoons chile-garlic paste, chile crisp or chile oil, or to taste    
* Half a cucumber, peeled, seeded and cut into 1/8-inch by 1/8-inch by 2-inch sticks    
* 1/4 cup chopped roasted peanuts    


#### Preparation    



#### Directions   
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
2. Add noodles and cook until barely tender, about 5 minutes. They should retain a hint of chewiness.
3. Drain noodles, rinse with cold water, drain again and toss with a splash of sesame oil.
4. In a medium bowl, whisk together the remaining 2 tablespoons sesame oil, the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame paste, peanut butter, sugar, ginger, garlic and chile-garlic paste.
5. Pour the sauce over the noodles and toss.
6. Transfer to a serving bowl, and garnish with cucumber and peanuts.

The Chinese sesame paste called for here is made of toasted sesame seeds; it is not the same as tahini, the Middle Eastern paste made of plain, untoasted sesame. But you could use tahini in a pinch. You need only add a little toasted sesame oil to compensate for flavor, and perhaps some peanut butter to keep the sauce emulsified.
