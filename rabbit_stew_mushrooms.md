[Rabbit Stew with Mushrooms](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/rabbit_stew_with_mushrooms/)  


#### Ingredients  

* Rabbit
* 1 1/2 pounds mixed mushrooms
* 1 ounce of dried porcini mushrooms
* 2 **heads** of garlic
* 1 large parsnip, peeled and chopped into large pieces
* 3 large shallots, chopped
* 1 cup sherry or white wine
* 1 - 2 cups mushroom soaking water
* 3 cups chicken stock
* 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil
* 4 tablespoons of butter
* 1 tablespoon fresh thyme, or 2 teaspoons dried
* Salt and pepper  
* 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley

#### Preparation  

1. Bring rabbit up to room temperature  
2. Roast the garlic<sup>1</sup>
3. Soak dried porcini & save the liquid  
4. Prep fresh mushrooms  
5. Peel and chop parsnip  
6. Chop shallots  
7. Chop the parsley  
8. Optional: Make rabbit liver thickener<sup>2</sup>  

#### Directions  

1. Heat a thick-bottomed large pot on high heat for 1 minute
2. Add the mushrooms and shake the pot  
3. Stirring continuously, dry sauté the mushrooms until they release their water  
4. Turn the heat down to medium-high and scrape up any mushroom bits off the bottom of the pan  
5. Salt the mushrooms lightly, and when the mushroom liquid is mostly gone, remove them to a bowl  
6. Add the butter to the pot and brown the rabbit, then remove when done 
7. Increase the the heat to medium-high and add the shallots to the pot  
8. Sauté until the shallots are nicely wilted, about 3 minutes
9. While the shallots are cooking, squeeze the roasted garlic into the mushroom soaking water, then whisk it together  
10. Add the sherry or white wine to the shallots in the pot  
11. Use a wooden spoon to scrape off any browned bits on the bottom of the pot then let the liquid boils down by half  
12. Add the mushroom-roasted garlic mixture and the stock and stir to combine  
13. Add thyme, mushrooms, rabbit, and parsnips  
14. Bring to simmer and cook gently for 90 minutes  
15. If using the crème fraiche-liver mixture to thicken the stew, turn off the heat, and when the stew stops bubbling, add the mixture and let it heat through for a minute before serving 
16. Stir in the parsely  

Serve with a crusty loaf of bread, a green salad and either a hearty white wine, a dry rose or a light red wine.

<sup>1</sup>Preheat the oven to 375°F. Slice the top third off the heads of garlic and drizzle the olive oil over them. Wrap the heads loosely in foil and bake for 45 minutes to an hour, or until cloves are soft and brown. Set aside to cool.

<sup>2</sup> If making the crème fraiche-liver thickener:  
* Mince the rabbit liver finely and move it to a small bowl  
* Vigorously mix in about 1 1/2 tablespoons crème fraiche or sour cream  
* Put the mixture into a fine-meshed sieve over a bowl and push it through with a rubber spatula  
* Reserve in the fridge.
