### Basque Lamb Stew #1  
* [Simply Recipes](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/basque_lamb_stew/)

#### Ingredients  

* 3 1/2 pounds (1.5 kilos) of lamb shoulder, cut into 2-inch pieces   
* 1 10-ounce can roasted red bell peppers, cut into 1/2 inch strips  
* 1 large ripe tomato, peeled, seeded, and chopped  
* 1 large onion, peeled and chopped
* Garlic, peeled and chopped
* 1/2 cup dry white wine  
* 1 cup dry, full-bodied red wine  
* 1 cup lamb (or chicken) stock  
* 1 sprig fresh rosemary, about 1 tablespoon chopped  
* 2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil  
* Piment d'Esplette  
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley  
* 1 bay leaf  
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper  


#### Preparation  

* Marinate lamb with garlic, rosemary, white wine: Combine the lamb, half of the garlic cloves, rosemary, and white wine in a medium bowl and let marinate for 2 to 3 hours  
* Drain the meat, discard the marinade, and pat dry with paper towels. 
* Mince the remaining garlic cloves.
* Peel and chop onion.  
* Peel, seed, and chop tomato.  
* Slice peppers. 


#### Directions  

* Heat olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan with lid, over medium-high heat and brown the meat on all sides (about 10 minutes per batch). Salt the meat as it browns.  
* Remove the meat from the pan.  
* Add the chopped onion to the pan and cook, scraping browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon, until the onions are soft, about 5 minutes.  
* Add the garlic and cook another minute.  
* Return the meat to the pan with the onions and garlic.  
* Stir in paprika, roasted peppers, tomatoes, parsley, bay leaf, and red wine.  
* Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and simmer uncovered for 15 minutes, allowing the liquids to reduce a bit.  
* Add the chicken stock, bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until meat is very tender, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. 
* Add freshly ground black pepper and more salt to taste.

Serve with rustic bread.
