### Sicilian Almond Granita  

#### Ingredients  

2 1/2 cups (600 milliliters) whole milk or unsweetened almond milk
2 cups (8 ounces/227 grams) sliced almonds
1/3 cup (about 3 1/2 ounces/106 grams) honey


#### Directions  

1. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the milk, almonds and honey and heat, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching, until the mixture comes to a gentle boil, about 12 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside for 30 minutes.

2. Transfer the mixture to a blender and puree until smooth, then strain through a fine mesh strainer, pressing on the solids (discard them after). You should get about 2 cups (480 milliliters).

3. Transfer the liquid to a medium high-sided pan, such as an 8-inch square baking dish; cover and place in the freezer for 4 hours. Every 30 minutes, stir the mixture with a fork, breaking up the ice crystals as they form, until the mixture has frozen into a soft, creamy ice.
