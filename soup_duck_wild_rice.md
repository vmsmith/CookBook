### Hearty Duck and Wild Rice Soup  

#### Ingredients 

* Duck meat  
* 1 Onion, about 1/2 pound, peeled and coarsely chopped
* 1 Carrot, trimmed, scraped and coarsely chopped
* 1 Garlic clove, peeled and thinly sliced
* 1 Cup of shiitakes  
* 10 cups of duck or chicken stock  
* 2 cups of cooked wild rice  
* 1 cup of finely minced raw leeks  
* 1 cup of finely diced raw carrot
* Salt and pepper as desired


#### Preparation  



#### Directions  

* Cut the duck into serving pieces. Crack the backbone in half lengthwise. Cut away and discard any peripheral fat from the duck pieces. Sprinkle the pieces with salt and pepper.
* Heat a heavy kettle and add the duck pieces skin side down. Add as many pieces in one layer as the kettle will hold. Cook these pieces until they are nicely browned, about four or five minutes. Continue until all the pieces are browned. As the pieces are cooked, strain off and discard the fat.
* Return all the pieces to the kettle and add the onion, coarsely chopped carrot and garlic and cook three minutes, stirring constantly.
* Add the broth and bring to the boil. Simmer about one hour or until the liquid is reduced to about six cups. Skim off any scum and fat from the top as it accumulates.
* Remove and reserve the meaty duck pieces, such as legs, breast, thighs and so on. Discard the bony parts, such as the backbone.
* Strain the six cups of duck soup into a saucepan and bring to the simmer.
* Remove the meat from the reserved duck pieces and cut it into small dice. There should be about two cups of meat.
* Cut the mushrooms into small squares. There should be about two cups.
* Put the mushrooms, diced meat, wild rice, leeks and carrots into a kettle and pour the hot soup over them. Let simmer about two minutes. Serve piping hot.
