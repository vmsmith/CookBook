### Basalmic Roasted Brussells Sprouts  

#### Ingredients

* Brussels sprouts, trimmed and cut in half through the core 
* Pancetta, diced small 
* Good olive oil 
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
* Good syrupy balsamic vinegar

#### Preparation 

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 
2. Cut the Brussels sprouts in half.
3. Dice the pancetta (see note below).

#### Directions

1. Place the Brussels sprouts on a sheet pan, including some of the loose leaves, which get crispy when they’re roasted. 
2. Add the pancetta to the pan. 
3. Add the olive oil, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper and toss with your hands. 
4. Spread out the mixture in a single layer. 
5. Roast the Brussels sprouts for 20 to 30 minutes, until they’re tender and nicely browned and the pancetta is cooked. 
6. Toss once during roasting. 
7. Remove from the oven, drizzle immediately with the balsamic vinegar, and toss again. 
8. Taste for seasonings and serve hot. 


Note: I use the small pre-diced pancetta from Harris Teeter. It’s over in the deli section.
