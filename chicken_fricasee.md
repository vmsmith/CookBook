### Variation

1 frying chicken, 2 ½ to 3 pounds, cut into serving pieces
1 thinly sliced onion
1 thinly sliced carrot
1 thinly sliced celery rib
4 tablespoons butter
½ teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon white pepper
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 cups boiling white chicken stock
1 cup dry white wine or 2/3 cup white vermouth
A small herb bouquet (2 parsley sprigs, 1/3 bay leaf, 1/8 teaspoon thyme tied in a square of cheesecloth)
2 egg yolks
½ cup whipping cream
Fresh lemon juice
Nutmeg

Dry the chicken well in a towel and set aside.

Cook the onions, carrots and celery slowly in the butter in a large, ovenproof casserole or large heavy skillet for about 5 minutes, or until they are almost tender but not browned. Push them to one side. Increase the heat slightly and add the chicken. Turn it every minute for 3 to 4 minutes until the meat has stiffened slightly, without coloring to more than a light golden yellow.

Reduce the heat, cover and cook slowly for 10 minutes, turning the chicken once. It should swell slightly, stiffen more, but not deepen in color.
Sprinkle salt, pepper and flour on all sides of the chicken, turning and rolling each piece to coat the flour with the cooking butter. Cover and continue cooking slowly for 4 minutes, turning it once.

Remove from the heat and pour in the boiling chicken stock, shaking the casserole to blend the liquid and flour. Add the wine, the herb bouquet, and more stock, or water, so the liquid just covers the chicken. Bring to a simmer and taste for seasoning. Salt lightly if necessary.

Cover and maintain a slow simmer for 25 to 30 minutes. The chicken is done when the drumsticks are tender if pinched and the chicken juices run clear when pricked with a fork. When done, remove the chicken to a side dish.

Simmer the cooking liquid in the casserole for 2 to 3 minutes, skimming off the fat. Then raise the heat and boil rapidly, stirring frequently, until the sauce reduces and thickens enough to coat a spoon nicely. Correct seasoning. You should have 2 to 2 ½ cups.
Blend the egg yolks and cream in a mixing bowl with a wire whip. Continue beating, and add the hot sauce by tablespoonfuls until about a cup has been added. Beat in the rest of the sauce in a thin stream.

Pour the sauce back into the casserole. Set over medium heat and, stirring constantly, reach all over the bottom and sides of the pan until the sauce comes to a boil. Boil for 1 minute, stirring.

Correct seasoning, adding drops of lemon juice to taste, and a pinch of nutmeg. Strain the sauce through a fine sieve.

Arrange the chicken in a clean casserole and pour the sauce over it. The fricassee can be warmed in the oven at 325 degrees for about 10 minutes.
