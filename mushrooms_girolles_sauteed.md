## Saut√©ed Girolles   

### Ingredients    
* 9 ounches of girolles
* 2 ounces of butter
* Salt and pepper

### Preparation   
* Brush off the girolles

### Directions   
1. Heat 2/3 of the butter in a frying pan over medium heat.
2. When the butter has melted, add the girolles, cover, and cook for 4 to 6 minutes, so that they release all their water.
3. Drain the mushrooms in a colander to remove all the liquid.
4. Leave the pan over high heat, return the girolles to the pan with the rest of the butter and brown them for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring frequently.
5. Season with salt and pepper and stir once more before serving.
