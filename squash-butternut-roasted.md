## Roasted Butternut Squash   

### Ingredients    
* 1 butternut squash, peeled, halved, seeded and cut into 1-inch pieces     
* 1-2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil or neutral oil (such as grapeseed)     
* Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
* Optional spices: Spicy hot paprika, warning cinnamon   

### Preparation   
1. Peel, half, seed, and cut up the squash
2. Preheat the oven to 425F   

#### Directions   
1. Toss the squash with the oil and salt on a sheet pan.
2. Spread it into an even layer.
3. Roast the squash on the bottom rack until golden-brown and the pieces release easily from the pan, 25 to 30 minutes.
4. Stir (and add any ground spices if you like), spread into an even layer, and cook until tender, another 5 to 10 minutes.
5. Let cool slightly on the sheet pan before eating.
