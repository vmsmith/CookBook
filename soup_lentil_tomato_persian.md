### Persian Lentil Tomato Soup   
[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2022/02/03/rezas-persian-lentil-tomato-soup-recipe/)   

#### Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons ghee or olive oil
* 1/2 medium yellow onion (8 ounces), diced
* 1/2 cup green or brown lentils
* 3/8 cup uncooked basmati rice
* 4 ounces tomato paste
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon dried mint leaves (optional)
* 1/4 teaspoon fine salt, plus more as needed
* 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 4 cups low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth, divided
* 1/4 bunch (1 ounce) fresh parsley, preferably curly, leaves and tender stems, finely chopped and divided, plus more for serving
* 1/8 cup fresh lemon juice (from 2 large lemons), plus more to taste
* Fresh herb sprigs, such as parsley, scallions, tarragon and/or dill, for serving, as desired (optional)
* 3 ounces feta, for serving (optional)

#### Preparation   
1. Dice onion   
2. Chop parsley   
3. Squeeze lemons   

#### Directions   

1. In a large Dutch oven or pot with a lid, heat the ghee or oil over medium-high heat until it shimmers.   
2. Add the onion, and stir occasionally until it starts to brown, about 5 minutes.   
3. Stir in the lentils and rice, coating them in the fat.  
4. Add the tomato paste, cumin, dried mint, if using, salt, pepper and cinnamon.  
5. Add about 2 cups of the stock, and stir to dissolve the tomato paste and evenly disperse the spices.  
6. Add the remaining stock, stir well, increase the heat to high and bring to a boil.  
7. Decrease the heat to medium-low, stir, cover and simmer until the rice and lentils are cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. (If the soup thickens more than youâ€™d like, add water, 1/4 cup at a time.)   
8. Taste, and adjust the seasonings, if needed.    
9. Stir in about three-quarters of the parsley and remove from the heat.   
10. Just before serving, stir in the lemon juice.    
11. Divide the soup among bowls, top with the remaining parsley and serve hot, with cheese and fresh herb sprigs on the side, if desired.
