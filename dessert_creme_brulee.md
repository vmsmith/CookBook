### Creme Brulee  

#### Ingredients

* 2 cups heavy cream (or 1 cup half & half and 1 cup heavy cream)  
* 5 tablespoons sugar  
* 4 large egg yolks  
* 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract  
* 3 tablespoons sugar (Demerara or coarse white sparkling sugar)  

#### Preparation 

* Preheat the oven to 350Â°F  

#### Directions  

1. Pour the cream into a 1-quart saucepan, and heat the cream just until it almost comes to a boil. Remove it from the heat.

2. Whisk together the sugar and egg yolks until the sugar dissolves.

3. Add the hot cream a little at a time; mix well.

4. Stir in the vanilla bean paste.

5. Pour the custard through a fine sieve or strainer, and pour it into four heart molds, or 1/2-cup capacity ramekins about 2" tall.

6. Place the molds or ramekins in a large baking pan. Pour enough hot water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the dishes.

7. Bake until the custard is set but still a bit jiggly in the center, about 30 minutes.

8. Remove the dishes from the water and let cool completely. Refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours, or up to overnight; no need to cover.

8. To serve, sprinkle the sugar evenly over the custards. For easiest caramelizing, run a torch evenly over the tops of the custards until the sugar is a deep golden brown. Or caramelize the sugar by placing molds or ramekins under your oven's broiler; watch carefully, as a broiler element can turn sugar from browned to burned quickly.
