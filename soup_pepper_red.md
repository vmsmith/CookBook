### Red Pepper Soup  

#### Ingredients  

* 3 pounds red bell peppers, halved and cleaned (8-10)  
* Fennel  
* 5 cloves garlic, in peel
* 2 cups chopped onion
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 large sprigs fresh thyme
* 2 bay leaves
* 4 cups chicken stock (or vegetable broth)
* Piment d'Esplette 
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper
* 1 - 2 tablespoons rice vinegar  
* Some rice to thicken  

#### Preparation  

1. Roast and clean peppers  
2. Peel garlic cloves  
3. Chop onions  

#### Directions  


While prepping the bell peppers, in a frying pan saute the onions with the olive oil until the onions are soft and translucent.
After peppers have cooled enough to touch, about 15 minutes. Remove from the tupperware and peel off the burnt skin. It will peel off. (I only peeled the burnt parts that were easily removed and left the skin that was still red and attached)
Place the bell pepper, garlic cloves, and onion into a food processor (affiliate link) and processes for about 3-5 minutes until there are no large chunks left.
Add the mixture to a large pot, add in the chicken stock, hot sauce, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer, cover and allow to simmer for another 20 minutes.
Remove from the heat. Stir in the sour cream. Place the oregano in your hand and crush it up slightly to release the flavor and to make the pieces smaller, then pour into the pot. Stir until completely combined.
Serve with extra sour cream and fresh herbs on top if desired.
Enjoy!
