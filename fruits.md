**Guyot:** Mid- to late-August  

Guyot, or Docteur Jules Guyot, is a early pointed, though slightly squat pear with a roughish yellowing peel, sometimes with a slight blush. This is not the most flavoursome of pears, but does have melting tender flesh which is very juicy and typical of many early varieties. It looks similar to the Bartlett (Williams’ Bon Chrétien) pear, though does not have quite the same eating quality unless harvested at the perfect time, and is slightly larger.
