### Fruits  

### Apples  

* Apples - Picardie - Verger de Picardie - Edgar Quinter:
  * Cox's Orange  
  * Pas de Loup  
  
**Boskoop** Originated in Boskoop, Netherlands, where it began as a chance seedling in 1856. There are many variants: Boskoop red, yellow or green. This rustic apple is firm, tart and fragrant. Greenish-gray tinged with red, the apple stands up well to cooking. Generally Boskoop varieties are very high in acid content and can contain more than four times the vitamin C of 'Granny Smith' or 'Golden Delicious'.

### Pears  

**Anjou:**  

**Comice:** October to February  

**Conference:** September to May  

A medium-sized pear with an elongated bottle, the 'Conference' pear is similar in appearance to the 'Bosc pear'. A table pear, it is suitable for fresh-cut processing. The fruit skin is thick greenish-brown, becoming pale yellow when ripe. The flesh is white, but turns pale yellow when the pear is ripe. The texture is very fine and soft, and the flavour is sweet. The brown part of the skin is called russet or russetting; it is more or less apparent depending on weather conditions.  

Compliment: Walnuts, almonds, pecans, ginger, garlic, onion, smoked fish, bacon, ham, and blue cheese  

Salad: Goat cheese, walnut, conference pear  

**Forelle:**

**Guyot:** Mid- to late-August  

Guyot, or Docteur Jules Guyot, is a early pointed, though slightly squat pear with a roughish yellowing peel, sometimes with a slight blush. This is not the most flavoursome of pears, but does have melting tender flesh which is very juicy and typical of many early varieties. It looks similar to the Bartlett (Williams’ Bon Chrétien) pear, though does not have quite the same eating quality unless harvested at the perfect time, and is slightly larger.

**Seckle:**  

**William:** Mid-August to October
