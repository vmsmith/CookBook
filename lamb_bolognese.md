### Lamb Bolognese

#### Ingredients  

* 1 pound ground lamb    
* 1 small red onion, diced  
* 1 carrot, peeled and diced  
* 3 ounces of pancetta, ground (or very finely chopped)
* 1 (28-ounce) can San Marzano plum tomatoes, pureed in a blender or food processor
* 2/3 cup white wine
* 1/3 cup heavy cream
* 1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground toasted fennel seed
* 6 ounces butter, cut into small pieces
* 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 1/2 teaspoons crushed red pepper, or more to taste
* 1 bunch fresh mint
* 1 bunch parsley, finely chopped
* Grated Parmesan, for serving
* Sea salt, to taste
* Coarse kosher salt, to taste

#### Preparation  


#### Directions  

In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, combine olive oil and crushed red pepper; toast over medium heat until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add red onion and cook, stirring, until tender, about 3-5 minutes. Add garlic, ground fennel, and carrots and cook for an additional 3-5 minutes, until carrots just begin to soften. Add pancetta to the pot and cook, stirring, until the fat has melted. Add ground lamb and cook until browned, breaking up the meat thoroughly with a wooden spoon so that no clumps form. Once the lamb has browned, stir in wine. Bring to a quick boil, then stir in the pureed tomatoes. Return mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer uncovered for 15 minutes. Cover the pot and simmer for 45 minutes. Stir in cream and continue to simmer for an additional 20 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt. When ready to serve, stir in butter and several sprigs of mint. Bring to a gentle simmer to melt butter and infuse mint. Stir in cooked gnocchi, thinning the sauce to your desired consistency with pasta water. Finish each plate with a pinch of finely chopped parsley, grated Parmesan, and a sprinkle of sea salt.
