### Lamb Bolognese

#### Ingredients  

* 1 pound ground lamb    
* 1 small red onion, diced  
* 1 carrot, peeled and diced  
* 3 ounces of pancetta, ground (or very finely chopped)
* 1 (28-ounce) can San Marzano plum tomatoes, pureed in a blender or food processor
* 2/3 cup white wine
* 1/3 cup heavy cream
* 1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground toasted fennel seed
* 6 ounces butter, cut into small pieces
* 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 1/2 teaspoons crushed red pepper, or more to taste
* 1 bunch fresh mint
* 1 bunch parsley, finely chopped
* Grated Parmesan, for serving
* Sea salt, to taste
* Coarse kosher salt, to taste

#### Preparation  

1. Dice onions  
2. Peel and dice carrot  
3. Dice pancetta  
4. Puree plum tomatoes  
5. Toast fennel seeds  

#### Directions (almost two hours)  

1. In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, combine olive oil and crushed red pepper, then toast over medium heat until fragrant (about 1 minute)   

2. Add the red onion and cook, stirring, until tender (about 3-5 minutes)   

3. Add the garlic, ground fennel, and carrots, and cook until the carrots just begin to soften (about 3 - 5 minutes)   

4. Add pancetta to the pot and cook, stirring, until the fat has melted   

5. Add ground lamb and cook until browned, breaking up the meat thoroughly with a wooden spoon so that no clumps form  

6. Once the lamb has browned, stir in wine   

7. Bring to a quick boil, then stir in the pureed tomatoes   

8. Return mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer uncovered for 15 minutes   

9. Cover the pot and simmer for 45 minutes   

10. Stir in cream and continue to simmer for an additional 20 minutes   

11. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt   

12. When ready to serve, stir in butter and several sprigs of mint   

13. Bring to a gentle simmer to melt butter and infuse mint   

14. Stir in cooked gnocchi, thinning the sauce to your desired consistency with pasta water   

15. Finish each plate with a pinch of finely chopped parsley, grated Parmesan, and a sprinkle of sea salt.
