* 1 cup dry white wine   
* Extra virgin olive oil  
* 1 Tbsp butter  
* Salt & freshly ground black pepper

#### Directions

9. Lower heat, cover tightly and let cook for 45 minutes  
10. Remove rabbit, strain liquid, and thicken the sauce

#### Optional Step

After the rabbit is cooked through, if you want, you can intensify the flavor of the sauce using the rabbit's liver. The liver acts as a "liaison", thickening the sauce and making it richer.  

A. Purée the rabbit liver with 1 Tbsp of wine or cider vinegar     
B. Remove the rabbit pieces, prunes, thyme sprigs, and bay leaf from the pot to a serving dish   
C. Whisk the puréed liver vinegar mixture into the sauce in the pot and cook for another 10 minutes   
D. If the sauce is still too thin, you can thicken further with corn starch or flour  
E. Drizzle the sauce over and around the rabbit and prunes
