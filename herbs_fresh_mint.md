### Mint  

#### Keeping fresh  

Method 1:  
* Wrap the mint leaves gently in a dampened paper towel.
* Place the mint in a plastic bag, not sealing all the way so that air can circulate. 
* Do not wrap tightly as trapped moisture will cause the herbs to mold.

Method 2:
* Trim the ends and place in a glass filled with about 1‚Äù of water.  
* Cover with a loose fitting bag and refrigerate.  
* Replace water when it gets cloudy.

#### Keeping frozen   

Ice Cube Method: 
* Pick through the fresh mint, removing damaged leaves and tough stems and rinse.  
* Gently spin dry or pat dry between two kitchen or paper towels.  
* Chop the mint leaves (remove stems) and place 1-2 teaspoons into each compartment of an ice cube tray, filling about halfway.  
* Top off with water and freeze.  
* Once the cubes have frozen, remove and store in an airtight freezer bag or container in your freezer, up to 3 months (label and date the bag). 
* Using frozen mint: Mint ice cubes can be used in sauces, teas and soups. To use the frozen mint as fresh, place the cube in a glass until melted and strain through a sieve to remove the mint from the water.

Baking Sheet Method:
* Follow step one from Ice Cube Method.  
* Place leaves on a baking sheet and freeze 2 - 3 hours.  
* Place mint into freezer bags, label, date and store in freezer up to 3 months.
