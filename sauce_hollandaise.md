### Hollandaise Sauce     

#### Ingredients  

* 2 eggs  
* 100 grams (3.5 ounces) of unsalted butter  
* 1 teaspoon of lemon juice  
* 1 teaspoon of mustard  
* White wine vinegar  

#### Preparations  

1. Separate eggs  

#### Directions  

1. Melt butter in a small pan – preferably one with a spout. If the pan doesn’t have a spout, then transfer the melted butter to a small jug that has a spout.    
2. Put the bowl of egg yolks over a pan of gently simmering water. Add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and 1 teaspoon of mustard.   3. Whisk together well.  
4. Gradually add small splashes of butter to the bowl with the yolks, whisking well between each addition.  

*Tip: Keep an ice cube readily available at this stage. If you can see that the mixture is starting to split, drop in the ice cube and whisk it in.*

5. Once all the butter is incorporated you should have a smooth, thickened sauce. Loosen the mixture with some white wine vinegar if needed.  
6. Spoon over the poached egg and serve immediately.
