### Red Lentil Soup  

#### Ingredients
1/2 cup red lentils (30¢)
1 large or 2 medium onions (31¢)
2-4 cloves of garlic (11¢)
1 carrot (16¢)
1 potato (15¢)
1 stalk of celery (16¢)
1 can of diced tomatoes (97¢)
1/2 to 1 tsp red pepper flakes
1 to 2 tsp of salt
1 to 2 tbsp of oil (15¢)
2 cups of water

#### Preparation  

#### Directions  

Rinse the red lentils in cold water until clear. (If you have extra time, then let the lentils sit in cold water for 30 minutes to soak - this softens them up and reduces cooking time.)
Dice onions. Mince garlic. Finely slice celery. Combine and set aside.
Wash (and optionally peel) carrot and potato. Shred or dice carrot and potato.
Heat oil in pot.
Add red pepper flakes and sauté for about two minutes. Keep stirring.
Add onions, garlic and celery and sauté until softened; about three to four minutes. Keep stirring.
Add carrots and potato and sauté until softened; about three to four minutes if you shredded the veggies and longer if diced. Keep stirring.
Add can of tomatoes. Add red lentils and water. Stir to combine.
Turn heat on high until boiling. Reduce heat, cover pot and simmer for about 20 minutes.
Add salt and stir.
Optional: I like a smooth soup so I give it a whizz with an immersion blender. Then I add half a package of frozen spinach (defrosted and heated in microwave while soup is cooking, extra cost is 50¢) and combine.
