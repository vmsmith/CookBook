[Reddit thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/gz1ouv/red_lentils_are_a_frugal_cooks_best_friend_30/)  

#### Ingredients  
* 1/2 cup red lentils

* 1 to 2 tsp of salt  
* 1 to 2 tbsp of oil  
* 2 cups of water  

#### Preparation  

1. Rinse the red lentils in cold water until clear. (If you have extra time, then let the lentils sit in cold water for 30 minutes to soak - this softens them up and reduces cooking time.)

4. Finely slice celery  
5. Optional: Wash (and optionally peel) carrot and potato, then shred or dice  

#### Directions

2. Add red pepper flakes and sauté for about two minutes (keep stirring)  
3. Add onions, garlic and celery and sauté until softened - about three to four minutes (keep stirring)  
4. Add carrots and potato and sauté until softened - about three to four minutes if you shredded the veggies and longer if diced (keep stirring)
5. Add can of tomatoes  
6. Add red lentils and water, and stir to combine  
7. Turn heat on high until boiling, then reduce heat, cover pot and simmer for about 20 minutes  
8. Add salt and stir  
9. Optional: Give it a whizz with an immersion blender
10. Add some thawed frozen spinach
