### Buerre Manié

Beurre manié (French "kneaded butter") is a dough, consisting of equal parts by volume of soft butter and flour, used to thicken soups and sauces. By kneading the flour and butter together, the flour particles are coated in butter. When the beurre manié is whisked into a hot or warm liquid, the butter melts, releasing the flour particles without creating lumps.

#### Ingredients  

* One part unsalted butter  
* One part regular flour  

#### Preparation

#### Directions  

1. Mix the unsalted butter and the flour, and then kneed, kneed, kneed  

2. Divide the kneeded mixture into tablespoon-size lumps, and then refridgerate
