The key for this classic pesto recipe is to add the basil at the very end instead of blending everything all at once. That way the basil doesnâ€™t get bruised or lose its flavor and maintains its vibrant green color. 

#### Ingredients  

* 1/2 cup roasted pine nuts
* 3 ounces of Parmesan, grated (about 3/4 cup)
* 2 garlic cloves, finely grated
* 6 cups basil leaves (about 3 bunches)
* 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 teaspoon of kosher salt

#### Preparations  

1. Roast the pine nuts  
2. Grate the Parmesan  
3. Mince the garlic  

#### Directions  

1. Put pine nuts, cheese, and garlic in a food processor and pulse until finely ground, about 1 minute.  
2. Add basil and place the top back on.  
3. With the motor running, add oil in a slow and steady stream until pesto is mostly smooth, with just a few flecks of green, about 1 minute.  
4. Season with salt.  

* If you want to use this with pasta, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente.  
* Drain, reserving 1/2 cup pasta cooking liquid.  
* Place pesto and 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter, cut into pieces, in a large bowl.  
* Add pasta and 1/4 cup pasta cooking liquid.  
* Using tongs, toss vigorously, adding more pasta cooking liquid if needed, until pasta is glossy and well coated with sauce.  
* Season with salt.
