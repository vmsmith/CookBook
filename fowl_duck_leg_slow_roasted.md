## Slow Roasted Duck Legs  

#### Ingredients   
* 2 duck legs, Duck should have a lot of fat on it
* 1 tsp Kosher Salt
* 1/4 tsp Fresh cracked black Pepper, to taste
* 1/2 tsp Garlic powder
* 1/2 c Red wine
* 1/4 c Balsamic vinegar
* 1 tbsp Honey

#### Preparation   

#### Directions   
1. Place the duck legs in a baking dish just big enough to hold them with the skin side up. 
2. Season the duck legs all over with the salt, pepper and garlic powder.
3. Let rest for 20 min at room temp.
4. Place the duck legs into the oven, turn to 275F and let cook for 2+ hours.    
5. Halfway through, start basting the duck legs with the fatty golden liquid it produced while cooking.
6. (Optional) Tent with aluminum foil to prevent drying.   
7. Once the duck is really tender, remove all the liquid from the baking dish and save it on the side to use in dishes later.
8. Add the wine, balsamic vinegar and 1 tbsp of duck fat to the baking dish with the duck.
9. Turn the heat up to 375F then put back into the oven and cook for 15 minutes.   
10. Baste the duck with the liquid then drizzle the honey on top and broil for one minute. Keep an eye on it so the skin doesn't burn.
11. Remove from the oven.

#### Added Touches   
* Toss in a few crushed juniper berries or a sprig of thyme during the long cook.
* After the fat is drained, scatter a handful of cooked prunes or roasted grapes in the dish with the wine/vinegar. They’ll caramelize and pair beautifully with duck.
* Swirl a little cold butter into the reduced glaze just before serving for extra silkiness.
