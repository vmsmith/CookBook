### Maltese Rabbit Stew  

#### Ingredients  
* A rabbit, cleaned and portioned  
* 3/4 bottle of full bodied red wine    
* 350ml of water (approx. 2 wine glasses of water)    
* 1 finely chopped onion   
* 2 garlic cloves (peeled and crushed)  
* Several bay leaves  
* 200g can tomato pulp (polpa) or mashed up plum tomatoes  
* 1 1/2  tbsps tomato puree  
* 1 carrot (peeled and sliced)  
* A few medium potatoes (peeled and roughly chopped)  
* Salt & pepper  
* 1 1/2 tbsps extra virgin olive oil  

#### Preparation  
1. Marinade the rabbit overnight in wine, garlic, and bay leaves  
2. Chop the onion  
3. Peel and slice the carrot  
4. Peel and chop the potatoes  
5. Peel and crush the garlic cloves  

#### Directions  
1. Remove the rabbit pieces from the marinade and shake off the excess liquid (don’t throw away the marinade – you’ll be using that later!).  
2. Heat up the olive oil in a heavy based saucepan on a high heat and sear the rabbit joints on all sides until lightly browned (approx. 4 minutes on each side).   
3. Remove the rabbit pieces from the pan and set them aside.  
4. Lower the heat and add more bay leaves and onions into the pan.  
5. Simmer the onions under low heat until they are browned (approx. 5 minutes).  
6. Add the garlic and continue to stir gently for another minute.  
7. Add the tomato pulp or the mashed plum tomatoes to the pan and increase the heat slightly.  
8. Cook for approximately 5 minutes.  
9. Add the marinade and increase the heat to  bring the sauce to a boil.  
10. Add the rabbit joints to the pan and mix them into the sauce, topping up the pan with water until all the rabbit pieces are covered.   
11. Cover the pan with a lid until it comes to boil and then reduce the heat to a medium simmer.  
12. Wait for half an hour and then add the sliced carrots, diced potatoes and tomato puree.   
13. Make sure all the vegetables are covered with liquid and continue to simmer the stew for another half hour.  
14. Wait another half and hour and gently move the lid to cover only half of the pan.  
15. This will allow the sauce time to thicken.  
16. Now it’s time to check whether everything is cooked.  
17. If the rabbit meat falls off the bone easily and the roots of the vegetable are tender, then your rabbit stew is ready!
