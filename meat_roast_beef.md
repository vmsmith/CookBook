On my last bimonthly trip to the supermarket to stock up on staples, I noticed the beef offerings had transitioned from mostly steaks and chops to large, inexpensive roasts like top round, eye rounds and tri-tip. This makes sense, given our slowed shopping cadence. But what’s the best way to deal with big, inexpensive cuts of beef?

Fattier, expensive cuts like prime rib or New York strip are celebratory centerpieces that do best when simply roasted with salt and pepper and served straight away. Leaner cuts can also be roasted successfully, provided you go low and slow. I like to place my roast in a cold oven, set it to 225 degrees Fahrenheit, and slow-roast the beef until it hits 125 degrees on a digital thermometer, which yields a rosy-pink doneness that extends from edge-to-edge, as well as enhanced tenderness. (The same enzymes that tenderize a dry-aged steak will work in overtime as you slowly heat them.)

I then finish it with a sear, which is faster, minimizing the amount of dry, overcooked meat around the exterior. (This technique, which I published in Cook’s Illustrated in a 2007 article about steaks, is now commonly known as “the reverse sear.”) Cooked this way and sliced thin, even a relatively tough, lean cut will come out tender and succulent.

But as good as warm roast beef can be, I’d suggest that leaner, inexpensive cuts actually taste better served cold, the next day — or, in a variety of preparations throughout the week. A cold roast beef sandwich on crusty bread slathered with horseradish sauce — equal parts mayo, sour cream or yogurt and drained prepared horseradish, with plenty of black pepper and a dash of Worcestershire — or adding slices to a Parmesan-packed Caesar salad are easy places to start, but it can get much better. (See below.)
