### Bechamel sauce  

#### Ingredients  

* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 tablespoons flour
* 1 1/4 cups milk, heated
* Salt
* Freshly ground pepper  
* Nutmeg...?  

#### Preparations  

1. Heat milk on low heat just until little bubbles begin to form at the edges, then remove from heat.

#### Directions  

1. Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan.  

2. Stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until the paste cooks and bubbles a bit, but don't let it brown â€” about 2 minutes.  

3. Add the hot milk, continuing to stir as the sauce thickens.  

4. Bring it to a boil.  

5. Add salt and pepper to taste, lower the heat, and cook, stirring for 2 to 3 minutes more.  

6. Remove from the heat.  

To cool this sauce for later use, cover it with wax paper or pour a film of milk over it to prevent a skin from forming.
