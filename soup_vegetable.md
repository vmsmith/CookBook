#### Ingredients

* 1 rib celery (about 2 ounces)  
* 4 scallions, trimmed  
* 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided  
* 1 large carrot (about 4 ounces), trimmed and scrubbed  
* 1 zucchini (about 6 ounces), trimmed  
* 1 small white turnip (about 3 ounces), scrubbed  
( 1 wedge green cabbage (about 4 ounces)  
* 1 to 2 russet potatoes (8 ounces total), scrubbed  
* One (15-ounce) can no-salt-added navy or cannellini beans, drained and rinsed  
* 1 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt, plus more to taste  
* 7 cups water

* 1 cup lightly packed fresh flat-leaf parsley or basil leaves, or a mixture

#### Preparation  



#### Directions   

Step 1  
Fit a food processor with a slicing blade and process the onion, celery and scallions. (Alternatively, you can roughly chop them by hand.)  

Step 2  
In a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil until shimmering. Add the sliced vegetables and saute until tender, about 3 minutes  

Step 3  
Meanwhile, cut the carrot, zucchini, turnip, cabbage and potatoes in halves or quarters lengthwise (getting them narrow enough to go through the food processor chute), and use the processor to thinly slice them. (Alternatively, you can thinly slice them by hand.)  
Add the vegetables to the stockpot, along with the beans, salt and water, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer until the vegetables are very soft and the soup is flavorful, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice, taste, and add more salt and/or lemon juice if needed.  

Step 4  
While the soup is cooking, change the food processor to the chopping blade. Combine the garlic and herbs with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in the bowl and puree until smooth. (Alternatively, you can finely chop the garlic and herbs by hand, and stir together with the oil.)  

Step 5  
Divide the soup among serving bowls, top each with a generous dollop of the herb mixture, season with the pepper, and serve hot.
