### Port and Berry Sauce   

#### Ingredients:
* 1 cup port wine (ruby or tawny)
* 1/2 cup mixed berries (e.g., blackberries, raspberries, or blueberries)
* 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
* 1 tbsp honey or sugar (optional, depending on sweetness preference)
* 1/2 cup chicken or pigeon stock
* 1-2 tsp cornstarch mixed with a little water (to thicken if desired)
* 1-2 tbsp cold butter, cut into cubes
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### Preparation    


#### Directions    
1. Simmer the Port: In a saucepan, pour the port wine and let it simmer over medium heat for 5-8 minutes, reducing by about half.

2. Add Berries and Vinegar: Stir in the mixed berries and balsamic vinegar. Let the mixture cook until the berries start to break down (about 5 minutes).

3. Add Stock: Add the pigeon or chicken stock, and let the sauce continue to reduce until it thickens slightly.

4. Thicken if Needed: If you'd like a thicker sauce, add the cornstarch slurry (cornstarch mixed with a little water) and whisk it in. Let it cook for another minute until it thickens.

5. Finish with Butter: Remove the sauce from heat and whisk in cold butter cubes to create a smooth, glossy finish.

Season: Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Add a bit of honey or sugar if the sauce is too tart.

Strain (Optional): If you prefer a smoother sauce, you can strain out the berry solids before serving.
