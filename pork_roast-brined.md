Brined Roast Pork
You want to use a relatively large, deep bowl or another container (such as a deep plastic one) that will comfortably fit the meat in it, submerged, along with the brine. If you have a little extra brine, you don't need to add it all, but you want enough to cover the meat. Feel free to use whatever aromatics you'd like. I gave quantities for what I used but you can swap out crushed allspice berries or a few cloves, or leave them out altogether.
Make sure the brine is cold before you add the meat - it should be "refrigerator cold" (about 40ºF/4ºC) - and don't re-use the brine.
Note that the pork roast I used was already tied, and didn't have a thick layer of fat on it. If yours does, it may throw off some additional fat, so you may wish to find a roast that's been trimmed of some of its thick fat. In the U.S. the cut that I used is called pork shoulder roast.
Course Main Course
Servings 4 servings
For the brine
5 cups 1,25l water
1/3 cup (60g) packed light or dark brown sugar
3 tablespoons gray sea salt or Diamond Crystal kosher salt, (if using Morton's kosher salt, reduce it to 2 tablespoons)
aromatics, such as 4 crushed bay leaves, 18 crushed juniper berries, 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, (optional)
For the roast pork
1 1/2-2 pound (700g-1kg) boneless pork shoulder roast, butcher-tied, if possible
low-sodium stock, or a mix of water, white wine, or apple cider, or just water
1 to 2 chopped shallots, or minced cloves garlic, and a few branches of fresh thyme, (optional)
To brine the pork
In a small saucepan, heat 1 cup (250ml) of water with salt, sugar, and aromatics, if using, stirring until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Once the mixture is warm, turn off the heat and let stand 10 minutes.
Find a deep container with the capacity to hold the pork and 5 cups (1,25l) of brine. Add the dissolved salt and sugar mixture with the infused aromatics to the bowl. Fill a 4 cup (1l) measuring cup with ice then add enough cool water to reach the 4 cup mark. Add the 4 cups of ice water (add the water and ice) to the bowl and stir. Put the pork roast in the cold brine, cover it with a plate to keep it submerged in the brine, and refrigerate for 2 to 3 days.

To roast the pork
Preheat the oven to 325ºF (165ºC.)
Remove the pork from the brine. Rinse it and dry it with a paper towel. (Be sure to clean your sink thoroughly afterward.) Put the pork in a baking dish that will fit it comfortably with some room around it, but not too large. Add liquid (low-sodium stock, or a combination of cider, white wine, and water) to the baking dish so it's about 1/2-inch (1,75cm) deep. If you'd like, add a few branches of thyme and a chopped shallot or two. I used a scant cup (250ml) of liquid but it may need more.
Roast the pork, checking the progress every 15-20 minutes, adding more liquid if the liquid gets close to completely evaporating. (Important: Don't let the liquid run dry if using a ceramic, glass, clay, or similar vessel. It can shatter if you pour liquid into a hot, dry baking dish.) There should always be 1/2-inch (1cm) of liquid in the baking dish. The pork roast will be done in 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours, depending on the size. It's done with the temperature reaches 145ºF (60ºC) if using an instant-read thermometer. Let cool for 30 minutes at room temperature. Pour the liquid into a small saucepan. If you'd like more liquid to serve with the pork you can add a little more stock and warm it before serving.
To finish the pork, preheat the oven to 475ºF (250ºC) and move the oven rack to the top third of the oven. Set the pork on a clean baking sheet.
Roast the pork until it's well-browned, which will take 12 to 20 minutes. Mine took almost the full 20 minutes but go by look and color rather than a strict cooking time.
