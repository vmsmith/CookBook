### Brined Roast Pork    

#### Ingredients   
* Pork shoulder
* Stock
* 1 - 2 chopped shallots  

#### Preparation   
1. Brine the pork (see below)
2. Preheat oven to 325F (165C)   

#### Directions   
1. Remove the pork from the brine, rinse it, and dry it with a paper towel.
2. Put the pork in a baking dish that will fit it comfortably with some room around it, but not too large.
3. Add the stock to the baking dish so it's about 1/2-inch deep.  (If you'd like, add a few branches of thyme and a chopped shallot or two.
4. Roast the pork, checking the progress every 15-20 minutes, adding more liquid if the liquid gets close to completely evaporating.
5. **Important:** Don't let the liquid run dry if using a ceramic, glass, clay, or similar vessel. It can shatter if you pour liquid into a hot, dry baking dish.) There should always be 1/2-inch (1cm) of liquid in the baking dish.
6. The pork roast will be done when the temperature reaches 145ºF (60ºC) if using an instant-read thermometer (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours).
7. Let cool for 30 minutes at room temperature.
8. Pour the liquid into a small saucepan. If you'd like more liquid to serve with the pork you can add a little more stock and warm it before serving.
9. To finish the pork, preheat the oven to 475ºF (250ºC) and move the oven rack to the top third of the oven. Set the pork on a clean baking sheet.
10. Roast the pork until it's well-browned, which will take 12 to 20 minutes. Mine took almost the full 20 minutes but go by look and color rather than a strict cooking time.
