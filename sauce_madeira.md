### Madeira Sauce   

#### Ingredients    
* Mushrooms—You can use white or chestnut mushrooms for this recipe. The latter is a bit firmer and has a nutty taste.
* Flour—To thicken the sauce slightly. By dusting the vegetables with flour and then lightly frying, you lose the raw flour taste, and you don't get any lumps in the sauce.
* Carrot, onion, tomatoes, and celery—Vegetables for flavoring the sauce.
* Thyme, bay leaf, and parsley—Herbs for flavoring the Madeira sauce.
* Tomato Paste—To deepen the flavor. But make sure you use it properly. To give it its delicious rich, and slightly sweet taste, you need to fry it for at least 2 minutes.
* Madeira—A Portuguese wine made on the island of Madeira. Among other things, a sweet taste with caramel, peach, and burnt sugar aromas. Often used as a dessert wine, but also used in cooking.
* Stock—Use the broth you get when stewing the beef tongue; it goes wonderfully with this recipe. But you can also use beef stock.


#### Preparation   



#### Directions   

1. Melt butter in the pan and add carrot, onion, celery slices, and tomato paste.   
2. Stir-fry for three minutes, then add the flour and fry for another two minutes.   
3. Add the tomatoes, parsley, thyme, and bay leaf to the sauce; also, add the broth.   
4. Bring to a boil and then simmer for about 15 minutes until the vegetables are tender.   
5. Meanwhile, fry the mushrooms in the butter for about 10 minutes, until golden brown.  
6. Pour the Madeira wine into the mushrooms and boil to evaporate the alcohol, about 2 minutes, then turn the heat down.  
7. Put the mixed vegetable sauce through a sieve, press everything well so that you catch the flavors, and add that to the mushrooms.  
8. Warm, taste and season with salt and pepper.
