### Pickled Red Onions   

#### Ingredients    
* 1 large red onion, sliced
* 1 cup white vinegar or apple cider vinegar
* 1 cup water
* 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
* 1 tablespoon salt
* Optional: whole spices such as peppercorns, mustard seeds, or bay leaves for added flavor

#### Preparation    
1. Peel and slice the onion, and place in a container with a tight fitting lid   

#### Instructions    
1. In a small saucepan, combine the vinegar, water, sugar, salt, and any optional spices you'd like to use.
2. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar and salt are completely dissolved.
3. Once the pickling liquid is ready, carefully pour it over the sliced onions in the jar, making sure the onions are completely submerged.
4. Let the pickled onions cool to room temperature, then cover the container with a lid and refrigerate it.
5. Allow the onions to pickle for at least 1 hour before using them, but for best results, let them pickle for at least a few hours or overnight to develop their flavor.

Pickled red onions can be stored in the refrigerator for several weeks.
