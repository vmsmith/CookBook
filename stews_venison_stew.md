### Venison Stew   

#### Ingredients
* 1 lb. venison, diced with all sinew removed   
* 1 Tbsp. olive oil   
* 2 and 1/2 cups new potatoes    
* 2 cups diced carrots    
* 1 cup frozen peas   
* 1 large onion, diced    
* 2 garlic cloves, minced    
* 2 tsp. herbs de Provence    
* 1 tsp. salt    
* 3/4 tsp. black pepper    
* 1 15 0z. can diced tomatoes    
* 4 cups unsalted veal stock    
* 3â€“4 dashes Worcestershire sauce
* Potato starch   

#### Preparation    
1. Dice the venison into chunks, and remove the sinew
2. Cut the carrots
3. Cut the potatoes in half (if necessary)
4. Cut the onions   

#### Directions   
1. Add the olive oil to a large pot or Dutch oven and heat over medium-high heat.   
2. When the oil is hot, allow the venison to saute for 5-7 minutes or until the edges start to brown.
3. Remove the venison from the pot and set aside.    
4. Turn the heat down to medium and add the potatoes, carrots, and onion.
5. Allow the vegetables to saute for about 8-10 minutes, or until they begin to soften. 
6. Add the garlic, herbs de Provence, salt and pepper and cook for an additional minute before adding the tomatoes, broth and Worcestershire sauce.
7. Add the venison back to the pot. Stir well and bring the stew to a boil.   
8. Once a boil is reached, turn the heat to low, cover the pot with a lid, and allow the stew to simmer for 1-2 hours until the venison is tender.   
9. Add the peas a few minutes before serving.
10. Add some slurried potato starch to thicken if desired.
11. Serve hot (is amazing with crusty bread).
