### Slow Roasted Pork Belly     

#### Ingredients    
* 3 pounds skin on pork belly, about 1 1/2 inches thick
* 2 tablespoons packed dark brown sugar
* 2 tablespoons + 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt

#### Preparation    
1. Score the skin in a cross-hatch fashion
2. Cut the belly into lengthwise strips (perpendicular to a bacon cut)
3. Combine the sugar and 2 tablespoons salt and rub this mixture on all the meaty sides of the strips
4. Rub the remaining salt into the skin, making sure to get down into the cracks
5. Dry brine the meat by letting it sit in the refrigerator, uncovered, at least 12 hours or overnight  

#### Directions   
1. Heat the oven to 250째F (121째C) and put pork on a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet.
2. Cook the pork until the internal temparature is 195F. This could take as little as three hours and as long as six.   
3. Remove the pork belly from the oven and adjust the oven heat to 500째F (260째C).
4. When the oven comes to temp, put the pork back in the oven.
5. Rotate the pan every 5 minutes until all the skin is puffy, crunchy, and crisp. (You may need to remove some pieces from the oven before others, as they can finish at different rates.)
