#### Lessons Learned - Cassoulet 2025   

* 1 500 grams bag of beans is **not** 1 pound . . . it's 1 pound plus.
* Don't serve wine before the prosecco or champagne or whatever.   
* The cassoulet bowl will easily serve 16 people.
* Steam and peel the duck legs a day before Paula Wolfert says to do them.
