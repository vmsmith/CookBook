[Eric Kim YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuCvIvU7LAg&t=672s)

#### Ingredients    
* 1 1/2pounds fresh wheat noodles for jjajangmyeon (see Tips)
* 8 ounces boneless, skinless pork belly, sliced crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick pieces
* 1 medium white onion, coarsely chopped
* 1/2 small green cabbage, cored and coarsely chopped
* 4 cups of chicken or pork stock
* 2 1/2 tablespoons chunjang, sometimes labeled as jjajang (fermented black bean paste; see Tips)    
* 2 tablespoons maple syrup
* 1 small russet potato
* 1 small cucumber, cut into thin matchsticks
* 1 tablespoon canola or grapeseed oil, plus more if needed

#### Prepatation   
1. Core and chop the cabbage
2. Chop the onion
3. Peel and grate the potato   


#### Directiosn    
1. Heat the oil in a Dutch oven, salt pork belly, and add to the pot.
2. Stir occasionally, until browned and some fat has rendered, about 10 minutes.
3. Raise the heat to high. Add the onion and cabbage and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and the bottom of the pot starts to get brown and sticky, 3 to 5 minutes. Add more oil if the bottom is dry.
4. Add the chunjang and cook, stirring constantly, until the pork is slicked with the paste, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
5. Stir in the chicken broth and maple syrup, scraping the bottom of the pot to release any caramelized brown bits.
6. Bring to a boil and reduce the heat to medium-low.
7. Cover and simmer until the pork is tender, about 20 minutes.
8. Stir it the grated potato and raise the heat to high to bring to a boil.
9. Cook, stirring occasionally, until thick like gravy, 10 to 15 minutes.
10. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil.
11. Cook the noodles according to package instructions, then transfer with tongs to a colander or sieve in the sink. Rinse under cold water until no longer sticky, then dunk back into the hot water to reheat the noodles.
12. Drain well, then distribute the noodles among bowls.
13. Generously ladle the jjajang sauce over the noodles, top with the cucumbers and eat immediately.

#### Tips   
1. Chunjang, the word for the fermented black soybean paste that forms the base of jjajang sauce, isn’t always listed on the label for this product. What you’re looking for is a jet-black paste, often labeled “black bean paste,” with ingredients like black soybeans, salt, wheat flour and caramel.
2. Jjajangmyeon-specific fresh wheat noodles can be found in the refrigerated and frozen sections of Korean grocery stores and most Asian markets. Delightfully chewy and elastic, they’re worth seeking out. They’re thicker, chewier and more substantial than Italian pasta, but a pound of linguine, thick spaghetti and bucatini can be substituted.
