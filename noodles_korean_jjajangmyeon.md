#### Tips   
1. Chunjang, the word for the fermented black soybean paste that forms the base of jjajang sauce, isn’t always listed on the label for this product. What you’re looking for is a jet-black paste, often labeled “black bean paste,” with ingredients like black soybeans, salt, wheat flour and caramel.
2. Jjajangmyeon-specific fresh wheat noodles can be found in the refrigerated and frozen sections of Korean grocery stores and most Asian markets. Delightfully chewy and elastic, they’re worth seeking out. They’re thicker, chewier and more substantial than Italian pasta, but a pound of linguine, thick spaghetti and bucatini can be substituted.
