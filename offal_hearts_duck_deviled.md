### Deviled Duck Hearts   

#### Ingredients    
* 12 to 24 duck hearts    
* 1/3 cup duck or chicken broth    
* 1/4 cup flour for dusting    
* 1 heaping teaspoon cayenne powder     
* 2 teaspoons salt    
* 1 tablespoon dry mustard    
* 1/4 cup duck fat or butter    
* 1/2 small onion grated, about 1/3 cup    
* 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce    
* 2 tablespoons minced parsley    
* Watercress or arugula or frisee    
* Crusty bread to serve    

#### Preparation    
1. Grate onion   

#### Directions   
1. Mix the salt, cayenne, dry mustard and flour together, then dust the hearts with it.
2. Heat the duck fat in a pan over medium-high heat.
3. When it's hot, drop the hearts into the pan and saute them for 3 to 4 minutes, shaking the pan and letting the little hearts roll around a bit.
4. Add the grated onion, Worcestershire sauce and broth into the pan and scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.
5. Swirl everything around so the hearts get coated.
6. Let the sauce reduce to a glaze, about 3 minutes or so over high heat.
7. Mix in the parsley and serve with watecress and crusty bread.
