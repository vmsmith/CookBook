## Cacio e Pepe Chicken Thighs   

#### Ingredients   
* Bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs    
* 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 medium shallot, finely chopped (about 1/4 cup)
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/4 cup dry white wine
* 3/4 cup heavy cream
* 1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth
* 1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns, coarsely crushed
* 1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest (from 1 medium lemon)
* 3 tablespoons finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese, divided, plus more for serving
* Finely chopped fresh parsley leaves, for garnish (optional)
* Lemon wedges, for serving (optional)

#### Preparation    
1. Chop shallot finely   
2. Mince garlic
3. Crush peppercorns
4. Grate cheese   

#### Directions   
1. Pat bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs dry with paper towels and season all over with kosher salt.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large 12-inch skillet over medium heat until shimmering.
3. Add the chicken skin-side down and sear until golden-brown, 13 to 15 minutes.
4. Flip and cook until the second side is golden-brown, 10 to 12 minutes more.
5. Turn off the heat.
6. Transfer the chicken to a large plate skin-side up (it will not be cooked through).
7. Remove all but 1 tablespoon of fat in the pan.
8. Add finely chopped medium shallot and 3 minced garlic cloves to the pan.
9. Cook over medium heat until translucent, about 1 minute.
10. Add 1/4 cup dry white wine and simmer, scraping up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pan, about 30 seconds.
11. Add 3/4 cup heavy cream, 1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth, and 1 tablespoon coarsely crushed whole peppercorns.
12. Bring to a rapid simmer, stirring regularly.
13. Reduce the heat to medium-low.
14. Return the chicken skin-side up to the pan and pour in any accumulated juices from the plate.
15. Simmer until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and the chicken is cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes.
16. Transfer the chicken to a serving platter.
17. Stir 1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest and 2 tablespoons of the finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese into the sauce.
18. Spoon the sauce around the chicken.
19. Garnish with the remaining 1 tablespoon finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese and chopped fresh parsley leaves if desired.
20. Serve with lemon wedges and more grated Pecorino Romano cheese if desired.
