### Butternut Squash and Pear Soup   

#### Ingredients  
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 large yellow onion (about 10 ounces), chopped
* 1 tablespoon finely minced or grated fresh ginger
* 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 2 pounds butternut squash, cut into 1-inch dice (about 7 cups)
* 2 ripe Bosc pears, peeled, cored and cut into 1-inch pieces
* 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 4 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth, or more as needed
* 3 tablespoons plain yogurt (low-fat or full fat)
* Water, as needed

#### Preparation   


#### Directions  
1. Heat the oil until shimmering and add the onion, then cook about 5 minutes.  
2. Stir in the ginger and the turmeric and cook, stirring, until aromatic, about 30 seconds.  
3. Stir in the squash, pears, salt and pepper.  
4. Add the broth and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until the squash is very tender, about 25 minutes.
5. Using an immersion blender, puree the soup, or let cool slightly, then puree it in batches in a stand blender until smooth.   
6. Add a little water or additional broth, if needed, to thin the soup to your liking.   
7. In a small bowl, whisk the yogurt with water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until thin enough to drizzle.   
8. Ladle the soup in bowls, drizzle with the yogurt and serve hot.
