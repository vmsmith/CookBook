### Butternut Squash and Pear Soup   

#### Ingredients  



2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large yellow onion (about 10 ounces), chopped
1 tablespoon finely minced or grated fresh ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
2 pounds butternut squash, cut into 1-inch dice (about 7 cups)
2 ripe Bosc pears, peeled, cored and cut into 1-inch pieces
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
4 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth, or more as needed
3 tablespoons plain yogurt (low-fat or full fat)
Water, as needed
Step 1
In a large stock pot over medium heat, heat the oil until shimmering. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in the ginger and the turmeric and cook, stirring, until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Stir in the squash, pears, salt and pepper. Add the broth and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until the squash is very tender, about 25 minutes.
Step 2
Using an immersion blender, puree the soup, or let cool slightly, then puree it in batches in a stand blender until smooth. Add a little water or additional broth, if needed, to thin the soup to your liking.
Step 3
In a small bowl, whisk the yogurt with water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until thin enough to drizzle.
