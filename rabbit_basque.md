#### Directions

1. Spread the flour in a shallow dish. Season the rabbit with salt and pepper, and dredge it in the flour. Shake off the excess flour. 

2. In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the oil over high heat. Add the rabbit, and cook it for 5 to 6 minutes, turning, until it is lightly browned. 

3. Lift the meat from the pan, and set it aside.  

4. Add the carrots, onions, and garlic, and cook them over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, until the onions are lightly browned. 

5. Reduce the heat, and cook the vegetables over low heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. 

6. Add the rabbit, wine, and water, and cover the pan. Cook over low heat for about 20 minutes, until the rabbit is cooked through. 

7. Steam the baby carrots for 8 to 10 minutes, until they're just tender. 

8 . Meanwhile, using a slotted spoon or spatula, remove the rabbit from the pan, and set it aside. 

9. Pur√©e the remaining ingredients in the pan in a food mill, food processor, or blender. 

10. Return the sauce to the pan, add the rabbit, and heat gently. 

11. Serve the rabbit and sauce immediately, garnished with parsley and the steamed carrots.
