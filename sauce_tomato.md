### Tomato Sauce (Marcella Hazan)  

#### Ingredients  

* 2  cups tomatoes, in addition to their juices (for example, a 28-ounce can of San Marzano whole peeled tomatoes)  
* 5  tablespoons butter  
* 1  onion, peeled and cut in half  

#### Preparation  

1. Peel and half the onion  

#### Directions  

1. Combine the tomatoes, their juices, the butter and the onion halves in a saucepan.   
2. Add a pinch or two of salt.  
3. Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer.   
4. Cook, uncovered, for about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally and mashing any large pieces of tomato with a spoon.   
5. Add salt as needed.  
6. Discard the onion before tossing the sauce with pasta. This recipe makes enough sauce for a pound of pasta.
