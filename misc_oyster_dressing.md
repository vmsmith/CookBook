#### Preparation   



#### Directions  

Step 1
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 9-by 13-inch baking dish.
Step 2
Crumble cornbread into a large bowl. Tear toasted white or wheat
bread into very small pieces, add to cornbread, and toss to combine
Step 3
Melt 8 tablespoons butter in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add
onion, celery and bell pepper; sauté, stirring occasionally, for 3
minutes. Cover pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are
almost translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove cover, add broth, and
cook, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan, for 2
to 3 minutes. Continue to cook mixture for 1 more minute, then
remove from heat, add to bread mixture, and stir to combine.
Step 4
In a medium bowl, stir together oysters, lemon juice, hot sauce,
parsley, sage, salt and white pepper. Add to bread mixture and stir well
to combine. If dressing seems too dry, add a little oyster liquor and up
to 1/2 cup more chicken broth; mixture should be very moist.  
Pour dressing into greased baking dish. Cut remaining 4 tablespoons
butter into small pieces and scatter over top of dressing. Bake until top
and sides are browned, 40 to 45 minutes.
