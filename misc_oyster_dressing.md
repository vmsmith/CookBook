#### Preparation   



#### Directions  

1. Heat oven to 350 degrees  
2. Butter a 9-by 13-inch baking dish  
3. Crumble cornbread into a large bowl. Tear toasted white or wheat bread into very small pieces, add to cornbread, and toss to combine  
4. Melt 8 tablespoons butter in a large sauté pan over medium heat  
5. Add onion, celery and bell pepper; sauté, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes   
6. Cover pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are almost translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove cover, add broth, and cook, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan, for 2 to 3 minutes  
7. Continue to cook mixture for 1 more minute, then remove from heat, add to bread mixture, and stir to combine  
8. In a medium bowl, stir together oysters, lemon juice, hot sauce, parsley, sage, salt and white pepper  
9. Add to bread mixture and stir well to combine  
10. If dressing seems too dry, add a little oyster liquor and up to 1/2 cup more chicken broth; mixture should be very moist  
11. Pour dressing into greased baking dish  
12. Cut remaining 4 tablespoons butter into small pieces and scatter over top of dressing  
13. Bake until top and sides are browned, 40 to 45 minutes
