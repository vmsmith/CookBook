### White Pesto  

This is the direct inverse of the normal basil pesto. It’s built on a combination of toasted nuts, creamy ricotta, and salty Parmesan, with a little kick coming from raw garlic and fresh oregano. You don’t need a food processor, a mortar and pestle, or a blender —- in fact, the entire sauce comes together in the same bowl you can use for serving.

#### Ingredients  

* 1/2 cup of chopped, roasted walnuts  
* 4 ounces of fresh ricotta  
* Zest of 1 lemon  
* 1 garlic clove, finely grated  
* 2 teaspoons of finely chopped oregano  
* 2 ounces of finely grated Parmesan (about 1 1/2 cups), plus more for serving  
* 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil    
* Kosher salt  
* Freshly ground black pepper  
* Tube- or rod-shaped pasta (such as rigatoni or linguine)  

#### Preparations  

1. Zest lemon  
2. Mince garlic  
3. Chop oregano  
4. Grate Parmesan  
5. Preheat oven to 350F

#### Directions    

1. Toast walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown (about 6–8 minutes).  Let cool, then finely chop.      
2. Vigorously mix walnuts, ricotta, lemon zest, garlic, oregano, and 2 ounces of Parmesan in a large bowl until well combined.    
3. Add oil 1 tablespoon or so at a time, stirring well after each addition, until all the oil is incorporated. 
4. Season with salt and pepper.

Then...


5. Cook pasta in pot of boiling water, stirring occasionally, until al dente.  
6. Scoop 1 cup pasta cooking liquid into bowl with pesto and stir gently to combine (it’s okay if some of the pesto is still in small clumps).  
7. Using a spider, tongs, or slotted spoon, transfer pasta directly to bowl with pesto.  
8. Mix energetically until pesto thickens enough to lightly coat pasta, about 2 minutes; the pasta should have sauce clinging to it but there should also be some extra sauce that collects in bottom of bowl.  
9. Divide pasta among bowls and serve with more Parmesan alongside for sprinkling over.
