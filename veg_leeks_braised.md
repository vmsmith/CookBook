### Braised Leeks  

#### Ingredients  

* Leeks   
* Garlic clove(s), minced   
* 3-4 Tbsp unsalted butter   
* Salt  
* 2 teaspoons fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried  
* 1 teaspoon sugar  
* 1 bay leaf  
* 1 cup white wine   
* 1/4 cup parsley, chopped  

#### Preparation  

1. Clean the leeks  
2. Mince the garlic  
3. Chop the parsley  
 
 #### Directions  
 
1. Heat the butter over medium-high heat in a sauce pan big enough to hold the leeks  
2. When the butter has melted and begins to foam, turn the heat down to medium and add the minced garlic and then the leeks, cut side down  
3. Cook for 1-2 minutes, just to get them a little browned and to let the butter get into the leeks  
4. Turn over and sprinkle with salt, then cook the other side for 1-2 minutes  
5. Turn the leeks back over so the cut side is down, sprinkle the leeks with the sugar, the thyme leaves and a touch more salt  
6. Add the white wine with the bay leaf and bring to a gentle simmer   
7. Cover and cook 35-45 minutes over medium-low heat  
8. When the leeks are tender enough so that a knife blade pierces them easily, uncover the pot and bring the braising liquid to a rolling boil   
9. Let this reduce by half, then turn off the heat   
10. Add the parsley, swirl it around and serve
