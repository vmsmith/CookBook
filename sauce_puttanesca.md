### Puttanesca Sauce  

#### Ingredients  

* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
* 8 anchovy fillets packed in oil
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, drained
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
* 1/2 cup pitted olives
* 1/4 cup drained capers
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
* Zest of 1 lemon  

#### Preparation  

1. Slice garlic  
2. Chop basil  
3. Zest lemon  

#### Directions  

1. Warm oil in a large pot over medium heat and add garlic and anchovies   
2. Cook until garlic is lightly golden and anchovies melt into the oil, 3-4 minutes    
3. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 1 minute   
4. Add tomatoes and crush them with a fork or wooden spoon    
5. Season to taste with salt and pepper   
6. Raise heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes break down and mixture becomes saucy, about 10 minutes    
7. Stir in olives, capers, basil, and red pepper flakes, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until it thickens, about 30 minutes  
8. Remove from heat and stir in lemon zest  
9. Season again with salt and pepper to taste  

**Note:**  When cooking pasta, reserve some of the water to thin out the puttanesca as needed before serving.
