### Port and Blackberry Sauce   

#### Ingredients   
* 1 small shallot, finely chopped    
* 1 tbsp unsalted butter    
* 1/2 cup port wine    
* 1/2 cup of blackberries (and perhaps raspberries, or a mix)     
* 1 tsp balsamic vinegar    
* 1/4 cup chicken or game stock    
* 1 tsp honey (optional, to adjust sweetness)
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
* 1 tbsp cold unsalted butter (to finish the sauce)

#### Preparation    
1. Finely chop the shallot
2. Make *beurre manier* (optional)   

#### Directions   
1. Sauté the shallots in the butter for 2–3 minutes until soft and translucent, but not browned.
2. Stir in the port wine and berries.
3. Let the mixture come to a simmer and reduce slightly, about 5–7 minutes.
4. Gently mash the berries with the back of a spoon to release their juices.
5. Add the balsamic vinegar and stock.
6. Simmer for another 5–7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly. (For a thinner consistency, add a bit more stock).
7. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning (add honey if the sauce is too tart).
8. For a smooth sauce, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. For a more rustic texture, skip this step.
9. Return the sauce to low heat (if strained) and whisk in 1 tablespoon of cold butter to give the sauce a glossy finish.    
10. Consider a thickener if too thin.
