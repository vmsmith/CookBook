### Blackberry and Raspberry Red Wine Sauce

#### Ingredients:
* 1/2 cup blackberries
* 1/2 cup raspberries
* 1 small shallot, finely chopped
* 1 tbsp butter (for sautéing)
* 1 cup red wine (e.g., Syrah or Cabernet Sauvignon)
* 1/2 cup cup game or beef stock (or chicken stock if that’s what you have)
* 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
* 1 tsp honey (optional, to taste)
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 1 tbsp cold butter (to finish the sauce)    

#### Preparation   
1. Chop the shallot   

#### Directions   
1. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat.
2. Add the finely chopped shallot and sauté until soft and translucent (about 2–3 minutes).
3. Pour in the red wine and stock, then bring to a boil.
4. Reduce the heat and let it simmer until the liquid is reduced by about half (10–15 minutes).
5. Add the blackberries and raspberries, mashing them slightly with the back of a spoon to release their juices.
6. Stir in the balsamic vinegar and let the mixture simmer for 5–7 minutes, until the sauce thickens slightly.
7. Taste the sauce and add a small amount of honey if the berries are too tart.
8. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to balance the flavors.
9. For a smooth sauce, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible.
10. Return the sauce to the saucepan (if strained) and whisk in 1 tablespoon of cold butter over low heat to give the sauce a silky finish.
11. Drizzle the sauce over the filet of biche just before serving, and consider garnishing with a few fresh berries for a touch of elegance.
