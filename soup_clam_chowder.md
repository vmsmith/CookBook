### Clam Chowder  

#### Ingredients   

* 12 ounces of clams  
* 2 russet potatoes, peeled and diced  
* 4 slices bacon, diced   
* 1 cup milk  
* 1 cup half and half*
* 1 cup seafood (or vegetable) stock  
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter  
* 2 cloves garlic, minced  
* 1 onion, diced  
* 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme  
* 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour  
* 1 bay leaf  
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste  
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves   

#### Preparation  



#### Directions  

Heat a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium high heat. Add bacon and cook until brown and crispy, about 6-8 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate, reserving 1 tablespoon excess fat; set aside.
Melt butter in the stockpot. Add garlic and onion, and cook, stirring frequently, until onions have become translucent, about 2-3 minutes. Stir in thyme until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk, vegetable stock, clam juice and bay leaf, and cook, whisking constantly, until slightly thickened, about 1-2 minutes. Stir in potatoes.
Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 12-15 minutes.*
Stir in half and half and clams until heated through, about 1-2 minutes; season with salt and pepper, to taste. If the soup is too thick, add more half and half as needed until desired consistency is reached.
Serve immediately, garnished with bacon and parsley, if desired.
