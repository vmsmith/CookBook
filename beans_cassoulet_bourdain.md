### Cassoulet à la Anthony Bourdain  

#### Ingredients   
* 1 1/2 cups of Tarbais beans  
* 1/4 pound of fresh pork belly   
* 2 Toulouse sausages  
* 1/4 pound of pork rind  
* 2 duck legs confit  
* 1 onion - cut into four pieces  
* 2 onions - thinly sliced  
* 1 garlic clove  
* Bouquet garni  

#### Preparation  
1. By day. 

#### Directions   

Day 1:   

1. Soak the Tarbais beans overnight.  


Day 2:

Prep: 
A. Quarter an onion   
B. Slice the other onions   
C. Chop garlic cloves   

1. Drain and rinse the beans and place in a large pot.    
2. Add the pork belly, the quartered onion, 112 grams (1/4 pound) of pork rind, and the bouquet garni.    
3. Cover with water, add salt and pepper, and bring to a boil.    
4. Reduce to a simmer and cook until the beans are tender (about an hour).   
5. Let cool for 20 minutes, then discard the onion and the bouquet garni.    
6. Remove the pork belly, cut into 2-inch squares and set aside.    
7. Strain the beans and the rind and set aside, and **reserve the cooking liquid separately**.   

8. In the sauté pan heat all but one tablespoon of duck fat over medium-high heat until it shimmers.   
9. Carefully add the sausages and brown on all sides, then remove and set aside, draining on a paper towel.   
10. In the same pan, over medium-high heat, brown the sliced onions, the garlic, and the reserved square of pork rind.   
11. Once browned, remove from the heat and transfer to a blender.  
12. Add one tablespoon of the remaining duck fat and blend until smooth, then set aside.   

13. Preheat the oven to 350F/180C. Place the uncooked pork rind in the bottom of a deep ovenproof earthenware dish.   
14. Layer beans, then sausages, then more beans, the pork belly, then more beans then duck confit,  and finally more beans.  Add a dab of the purée between each layer.   
15. Add enough of the bean cooking liquid (or chicken stock) to just cover the beans. Reserve one cup.   
16. Cook for about an hour, then reduce the heat to 250F / 130C.   
17. Cook another hour, let cool, and refrigerate overnight.   

Day 3:  

1. Preheat oven to 350F / 180C.   
2. Cook the cassoulet for an hour.  
3. Break the crust on top with a spoon and add ¼ cup of the cooking liquid (or stock).   
4. Reduce heat to 250F / 130C and cook another 15 minutes.
