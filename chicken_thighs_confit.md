### Chicken Thighs Confit  

#### Ingredients  

* Skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs  
* Enough extra-virgin olive oil to cover the chicken  
* 2 large leeks, tough outer layer and dark tops removed, halved, cleaned and cut into 1-inch pieces  
* 1 lemon, thinly sliced  
* 4 garlic cloves, smashed, plus 2 garlic heads, unpeeled and halved crosswise  
* 1 1/2 tablespoons fine sea salt, plus more as needed
* 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more as needed
* 4 fresh thyme sprigs
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 1/2 cups green olives, such as Picholine or Lucques

#### Preparation  

1. Prep leeks  
2. Slice lemon

4. Pre-heat oven to 275F

#### Directions  

1. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and season with the salt and pepper  
2. Transfer to a bowl along with the lemon slices, garlic cloves, thyme, and bay leaves and cover with a lid or an upside-down dinner plate  
3. Refrigerate overnight  
4. Place the leeks and garlic head halves in the bottom of a large Dutch oven  
5. Add the chicken, lemon slices, and herbs  
6. Pour in the oil (it should cover the chicken completely) and cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid  
7. Bake for 2 hours, then add the olives to the pot and return to the oven for 15 minutes more  
8. Preheat the broiler  
9. Set an ovenproof cooling rack on a baking sheet and use a slotted spoon to transfer the chicken thighs to the rack  
10. Broil until the chicken skin is crisp and browned, 5 to 8 minutes depending on the strength of your broiler  
11. Transfer the chicken thighs to a serving platter and use the slotted spoon to fish out the leeks, olives, garlic and lemons and scatter them around the chicken  
12. Serve warm.
