4. Heat four tablespoons of olive oil in the empty pine nut pan on a medium heat, add the onion, peppers and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.
5. Cook, stirring often, for 18-20 minutes, until very soft.
6. Stir in the garlic, sun-dried tomato paste and the remaining harissa.
7. Add the chopped tomatoes and let everything bubble and blip away for 10 minutes.
8. Fold the parsley through the sauce, then crack the eggs into the tomato mixture and cover with a lid for a minute.
