#### Ingredients

* 2 rabbit livers
* 1/2 cup organic milk  
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 3 - 4 sprigs tarragon, chopped
* 1 tablespoon butter
* Kosher salt
* Freshly ground black pepper

#### Preparation  

1. Soak livers in milk for 2-3 hours prior to cooking, then rinse, pat dry and season with salt and pepper, and finally slice livers into bite-sized pieces  
2. Chop garlic  
3. Chop tarrgon  

1. Heat up a small saute pan on medium-high heat and melt butter

2. Add garlic, stir constantly until they start to turn golden brown.

3. Add livers and cook about 2 - 3 minutes on each side, until golden brown (there should be no pink in the middle) 

**Note:** Be mindful of the garlic by stirring often - by the time the livers are cooked the garlic should be a sticky golden brown
