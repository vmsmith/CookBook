### Roasted Chicken Provencal  

#### Ingredients:

* Chicken thighs, bone in
* Kosher salt
* Freshly ground pepper
* All purpose flour
* Olive oil
* Herbs de Provence
* 1 lemon, quartered
* 8 – 10 garlic cloves, peeled
* 4 – 6 medium size shallots, peeled and halved
* 1/3 cup of dry vermouth
* 4 sprigs of thyme, for serving

#### Preparation:

1. Quarter lemon
2. Peel garlic cloves
3. Peel and half shallots
4. Preheat oven to 400F

#### Directions:

1. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. 

2. Put the flour in a shallow pan, and lightly dredge the chicken in it, shaking the pieces to remove excess flour. 

3. Swirl the oil in a large roasting pan, and place the floured chicken in it. 

4. Season the chicken with the herbes de Provence. 

5. Arrange the lemon, garlic cloves and shallots around the chicken, then add the vermouth to the pan. 

6. Put the pan in the oven, and roast for 25 to 30 minutes, then baste it with the pan juices.

7. Continue roasting for another 25 to 30 minutes, or until the chicken is very crisp and the meat cooked through. 

8. Serve in the pan or on a warmed platter, garnished with the thyme.
