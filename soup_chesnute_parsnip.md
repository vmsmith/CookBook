### Chestnut - Parsnip Soup   

#### Ingredients  
* 200g/7oz cooked chestnuts (sold vacuum-packed)
* 600g/1lb 5oz parsnips, chopped
* 1 small leek, trimmed and chopped
* 2 pints stock (preferably homemade)
* 150ml/5fl oz white wine
* 100g/3½oz unsalted butter
* salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 8 scallops

#### Preparation   
1. Chop the leek
2. Peel and cut up the parsnip

#### Directions   
1. Melt half of the butter in a large heavy-based saucepan over a gentle heat but do not allow it to colour.
2. Add the parsnips and leek and let them fry gently for about 4-5 minutes, or until the parsnip is soft.
3. Add the white wine and chestnuts (reserving a few for garnish) and fry gently for a further 7-8 minutes.
4. Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste.
5. Add the stock to the saucepan and bring to the boil, then simmer for 5-6 minutes.
6. Remove the pan from the heat and blend with an immersion blender or in a food-processor until it’s nice and smooth. (If you’re using a food processor, allow the soup to cool a little before you blend it.) Pass the soup through a fine sieve and set aside.
7. Heat a large frying pan and add the butter. Once melted, add the scallops and cook on each side for 1-2 minutes.
8. Divide the seared scallops among four shallow serving bowls and ladle the soup around.
9. Grate the reserved chestnuts on top.
