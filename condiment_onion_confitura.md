### Onion Confitura  

#### Ingredients

* 3 lbs onions (any kind - all yellow, or a mix)   
* 1/2 cup olive oil  
* 1/2 - 1 oz herbs still on stems (here I used rosemary, but thyme or whatever would be fine)  
* 3 bay leaves  
* 1/2 cup honey  
* 1/4 cup sugar  
* 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar  
* 1/4 cup red wine vinegar (or white wine or cider or champagne)  
* 1/4 cup white wine  
* 4 teaspoons of sea salt    
* Pepper as desired  

#### Preparation

1. Cut onions crosswise in 1/4inch strips  

#### Directions

1. Add the olive oil to the pot and heat to medium.  
2. Add the onions.   
3. Use about half of the salt and a few grinds of pepper.   
4. Stir together enough to thoroughly coat onions with oil and salt and pepper.   
5. Make nests throughout the onions and add the bay leaves and whatever herbs being used.   
5. Cover the nests with onions.  
6. Cover the pot with a lid and let it cook for 15 minutes.  
7. Check it every so often to make sure it's not burning. It shouldn't be a problem. Drop the temperature a little if necessary.  
8. Uncover the onions and give them a stir.  
9. Add the sugar, red wine vinegar, white wine, balsamic vinegar, and honey.   
10. Cook this until the liquid is reduced by half, 15 to 30 minutes.  
11. When the liquid has reduced pick out the herb stems and bay leaves.  
12. Reduce the liquid away now until there is a thick jam consistency. The level of left over liquid is optional.

#### Canning

If you have a huge pressure cooker then hot water can in that. If you have a huge stock pot like mine, then invest in a wire steamer rack that fits it. You'll boil faster, you'll boil harder,  you'll come back up to boil faster, and well, you won't have one of those suck canning pots around.

Sterilize your cans and lids and utensils in the water you're heating up in the stock pot. Fill the cans using a ladle and that nifty canning funnel. Work some of the air bubbles out with a sterilized butter knife or something (you won't get them all out and don't worry about it). Put the lid and band on finger tight. Plunge it into the water bath for 10 minutes. Remove and let cool on a folded up towel for several hours. Done.

It's quick and easy. If you organized well you could go from having no onion confiture to having canned onion confiture in 2 hours. Most of that time will be spent waiting or being efficient and doing something else like cleaning your kitchen.

I'd recommend using half pint jars. I didn't know we had any (they were hiding in the quart jar boxes) and used pints. I only got two out this recipe. So use the smaller jars or scale the recipe up two or three times
