### Spanish Fish Stock  

[Seafood Paella](https://github.com/vmsmith/CookBook/blob/master/rice_risotto_paella-seafood.md)  

#### Ingredients  

* 1 fish head/tail/carcass    
* 4 prawn or shrimp heads and shells    
* 1 carrot  
* 1 leek  
* 1/2 head of garlic 
* 1 stick of celery  
* 1 small onion  
* 1 bay leaf  
* 1 sprig parsley  
* 1/2 tsp whole peppercorns  
* 1/2 tsp salt  
* 2 liters (roughly 2 quarts + 1/2 cup) of water  
* 2 Tb olive oil  
* 1/3 cup white wine  
* 1 star anise  
* 1 small fennel bulb    

#### Preparation   

1. Wash the fish thoroughly to remove blood and any contaminates that might make the stock bitter  
2. Coarsely chop the vegetables  

#### Directions  

1. Heat the olive oil in a pot until smoking hot, add the prawn heads, crushing them to squeeze out the various juices and “bits”  
2. Cook for one minute, then turn the heat down to low  
3. Add the carrot, leek, garlic, and celery, and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes until vegetables are soft  
4. Add the fish head and brown on all sides  
5. Deglaze with the white wine, scraping up any bits that may have stuck to the pan, cook until most of the liquid has evaporated  
6. Add the water, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to keep it at a simmer and cook for 15 minutes   
7. Skim off any foam that rises to the top  
8. Strain into a bowl, then return the liquid to the pot, add the bay leaf, peppercorns, salt, star anise, and fennel bulb (also coarsely chopped). Let infuse for 15 minutes off the heat (you can leave it
longer if you want to do this in advance - 30-40 minutes to intensify the flavor)  
9. Strain again, return to the pot, and put the pot over low heat
