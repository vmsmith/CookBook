### Sauce Soubise   

#### Ingredients   
* 1 1/2 cups heavy cream    
* 2 medium onions, thinly sliced    
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter     
* 1 teaspoon curry powder or Vadouvan spice, optional (see note)    
* Kosher salt   
* Ground white pepper, to taste

**Note:** Vadouvan, a French curry powder flavored with shallots and garlic, is available in specialty food stores and online.    

#### Preparation    
1. Slice onions   


#### Directions   
1. In a medium saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat until foaming.
2. Add onions along with a large pinch of salt and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and most liquid has evaporated, about 20 minutes.
3. Stir in cream and simmer for 5 minutes.
4. Transfer hot onions and cream to a blender.
5. Add curry powder or Vadouvan if using, and blend, starting at low speed and gradually increasing to high, until a smooth sauce forms.
6. If desired, pass sauce through a fine-mesh strainer, pressing on solids with a spoon, for an even more refined texture.
7. Return onion sauce to saucepan and season with salt and white pepper (note that sauce should have a texture that's thicker than most sauces but thinner than a puree).
8. Keep warm.
