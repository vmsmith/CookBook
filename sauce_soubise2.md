### Sauce Soubise   
[Soubise Sauce](https://www.seriouseats.com/soubise-french-onion-sauce-recipe-7101058)    

#### Ingredients   
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 2 medium onions, thinly sliced
* 1 1/2 cups heavy cream
* 1 teaspoon curry powder or Vadouvan spice, optional (see note)
* Kosher or sea salt   
* Ground white pepper, to taste

#### Preparation    
1. Slice the onions   

#### Directions   
1. In a medium saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat until foaming.
2. Add the onions along with a large pinch of salt.
3. Cook, stirring frequently, until softened and most liquid has evaporated, about 20 minutes.
4. Stir in cream and simmer for 5 minutes.
5. Transfer hot onions and cream to a blender.
6. Add curry powder or Vadouvan if using, and blend, starting at low speed and gradually increasing to high, until a smooth sauce forms.
7. If desired, pass sauce through a fine-mesh strainer, pressing on solids with a spoon, for an even more refined texture.
8. Return onion sauce to saucepan and season with salt and white pepper (note that sauce should have a texture that's thicker than most sauces but thinner than a puree).
9. Keep warm.
