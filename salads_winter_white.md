### Winter White Salad  

##### Ingredients  

* 3/4 pounds of mixed winter white vegetables (such as cauliflower, fennel bulbs, daikon radishes, and/or turnips)  
* 2 white endive, leaves separated  
* 1 Asian pear or firm Bosc pear, halved lengthwise, cored, thinly sliced  
* 3 oz. Piave cheese, shaved  
* 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil  
* 1 tsp. finely grated lemon zest  
* 3 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice, divided  
* Flaky sea salt  
* Freshly ground black pepper  
* 1/2 cup whole milk yogurt  
* 1/4 cup mayonnaise  
* 1 garlic clove, finely grated  
* Kosher salt  

#### Preparation  

1. Separate endive leaves  
2. Slice pear  
3. Shave cheese  
4. Zest and juice lemon  

#### Directions  

Trim stems of vegetables. Cut out core of cauliflower (if using). Thinly slice vegetables crosswise about Â¼" thick.

Toss vegetables, endive, pear, and cheese in a large bowl. Add oil and 1 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice; season with sea salt and pepper. Using your hands, toss salad until well coated. Chill (uncovered is fine) while you prepare the dressing.

Whisk yogurt, mayonnaise, garlic, lemon zest, and remaining 2 Tbsp. lemon juice in a small bowl; season with kosher salt.

Arrange about one-quarter of salad on a large platter. Drizzle some dressing over, letting it fall into the nooks and crannies of the vegetables. Add another one-quarter of salad; drizzle with dressing in same manner. Repeat with remaining salad and dressing. Season with kosher salt and pepper.
