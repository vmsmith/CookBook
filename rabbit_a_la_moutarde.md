### Rabbit à la Moutarde  

#### Ingredients  
* 1 rabbit (of course)
* Some bacon (see Note 1, below)
* Crème fraîche
* Fresh thyme
* 1 medium onion
* 1 large shallot (or two small shallots)
* 2 cloves of garlic
* White wine (see Note 2, below)
* Olive oil
* Flour
* Salt and pepper
* Dijon mustard

#### Preparation  

1. Cut the rabbit, then salt and pepper it and put some mustard on both sides  

2. Cut the bacon into squares    

3. Dice the onion, shallot, and garlic  

4. Pour out a cup and a half of the white wine  

5. Preheat the oven to about 350F


#### Directions  

1. Heat some olive oil in the pot over medium-high heat.

2. Cook each side of the rabbit until it gets a nice brown finish.

3. Remove the rabbit and place to the side.  

4. Sauté the bacon squares (or lardons if you have them) in the hot oil for a bit.

5. After the bacon ready, add the diced onions, shallots, and garlic and sauté until the onions are translucent (about 5 – 7 minutes).

6. Stir from time to time to prevent burning.

7. While the onions, shallots, and garlic sauté, lightly dust the rabbit with flour.

8. When the vegetables are ready, add the rabbit back into the pot and cook it for a few minutes on each side.

9. Then pour in the wine, and bring to a gentle boil.

10. Add a few sprigs of fresh thyme.

11. Cover the pot and let it cook on the stove top for a few minutes.

12. Put it in the oven, covered, for about 45 minutes.
