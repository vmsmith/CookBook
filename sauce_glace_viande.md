### Glace de Viande   

#### Ingredients   
* Stock  
  * Beef  
  * Veal  
  * Fowl   

#### Directions   
1. In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring the stock to a boil and then lower the heat to medium.  
2. As the stock simmers, skim scum and impurities off with a ladle.  
3. Once the stock has reduced by a little over half, pour it through a mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth into â€‹a smaller pot.   
4. Lower the heat a bit and continue reducing, skimming as needed.   
5. The glace is finished when the liquid has reduced by over three-fourths and the glace is thick and syrupy.   
6. When stirred, the glaze should coat the back of the spoon.  
7. Let the glace cool, then freeze.
