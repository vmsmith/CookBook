### Sweet Basque Cream  

#### Ingredients

* 1 pint of heavy cream
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 3 large eggs
* 3/8 cup of sugar
* 1/2 tablespoon of vanilla extract
* Ground cinnamon  

#### Preparations  

* Whisk the eggs, sugar, and vanilla together in a bowl until they are well mixed.   

#### Directions

1. Combine the cream and cinnamon stick in a saucepan over high heat, and bring to a boil.  
2. Reduce the heat to low, and cook gently – stirring occasionally to keep the milk from scorching – for about 10 minutes (until the cream is infused with cinnamon). 
3. Take it off the stove and set it aside for the cream to cool.  
4. When the cream is cool, slowly add it (and cinnamon the stick) to the egg mixture, and whisk together.  
5. Heat 1 or 2 inches of water in the bottom of the double boiler, then transfer the custard mixture to the top pan.  
6. Bring the water to a boil, then cook the mixture – stirring constantly – for about 30 minutes or until it thickens. Add more hot water to the bottom if necessary.  
7. Once the mixture has thickened, remove the top pan and let the mixture cool.  
8. Strain the cooled custard into a glass or ceramic container, then refrigerate for at least four hours.  
9. Stir it just before serving, and add a bit more heavy cream if necessary to smooth it out.  
10. Spread it on top of the cake or dessert, and sprinkle it with ground cinnamon.
