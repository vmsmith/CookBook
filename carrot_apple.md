### Carrot - Apple Soup  

#### Ingredients  

* 1 tablespoon olive or canola oil  
* 1 small yellow onion, chopped  
* 1 pounds carrots, peeled and cut crosswise into thin slices  
* 1/2 an apple, peeled (optional), cored and chopped, plus more for garnish  
* 1/4 teaspoon fine salt, plus more to taste  
* 4 cups no-salt-added chicken or vegetable broth  
* 1/4 cup Greek-style or plain low-fat yogurt (optional)  

#### Preparation   
1. Peel and chop the onion   
2. Peel and cut the carrots  
3. 3. Peel, core, and chop the apple  

#### Directions  
1. Warm a large pot over medium heat until hot. Carefully add the oil, followed by the onion, carrots and apple. Stir to coat the ingredients in the oil, season with salt, then cover and cook until the ingredients start to soften, about 15 minutes. From time to time, lift the lid and stir with a wooden spoon.

Increase the heat to high, add the chicken or vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, and cook until the carrots are completely tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool for 20 minutes.

Using a slotted spoon, transfer the solids to the blender or food processor and process until smooth. Add the yogurt, if desired, and process again, then stir this mixture back into the soup. Taste, and season with additional salt, if desired.

Serve right away, or cover and refrigerate until needed.
