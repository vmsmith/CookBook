### Glazed Carrots with Honey and Thyme

#### Ingredients

* 1/1 pound carrots, peeled and sliced at an angle, 1/4-inch thick  
* 1/4 cup chicken broth  
* 3 x 1/2 tablespoons honey, divided  
* 1/2 tablespoon butter  
* 1/4 teaspoon minced fresh thyme  
* 1 teaspoon lemon juice  
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper  

#### Preparation  

* Peel and slice carrots  
* Mince thyme leaves  
* Extract lemon juice

#### Directions

1. Place carrots, broth, 1/2 tablespoon honey, and salt in an approximately 12-inch skillet set over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. 

2. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Carrots should be almost tender when pierced with the point of a knife.  

3. Uncover pan, increase heat to high, and bring to a rapid simmer.  

4. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 1 to 2 minutes or until liquid is reduced to a couple of tablespoons.  

5. Add butter, remaining 1 tablespoon of honey, and thyme to skillet, tossing until butter is melted and carrots are coated.  

6. Cook for about 3 more minutes, stirring frequently, until carrots are completely tender and glaze has thickened and turned a light golden color.

7. Remove skillet from heat, stir in lemon juice, and season with pepper. 

8. Serve immediately, spooning glaze over individual servings.
