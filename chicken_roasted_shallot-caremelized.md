[David Levobitz blog](https://www.davidlebovitz.com/roast-chicken-recipe-caramelized-s/)  

#### Ingredients  

* Chicken pieces 
* 4 shallots about the size of an unshelled walnut and total weight of about 6 ounces (170g)
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 4 large shallots, peeled and minced
* Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
* One generous handful of coarsely chopped flat-leaf parsley

#### Preparation  

1. Preheat the oven to 425ºF (220ºC)  
2. Chop shallots  
3. Chop parsley  

#### Directions  

1. In a large baking dish, mix the olive oil, vinegar, soy sauce, shallots, and some salt and pepper  

2. Toss the chicken in the mixture so it's completely coated with the shallots  

3. Turn the chicken pieces so they are all skin side up  

4. Roast the chicken until it starts to brown on top, about 20 minutes  

5. Turn the pieces of chicken over and scrape any juices and shallots over the chicken that may be clinging to the pan

6. Bake for another twenty minutes, or until the pieces of chicken are cooked through and the shallots are well-caramelized 

7. Remove from oven and toss with the chopped parsley  

Serve with roasted or steamed vegetables, potatoes, rice, pasta, or a green salad.
