### Veal Kidneys à la Moutarde   

#### Ingredients   
* 1 fresh whole veal kidney
* 3 cups of veal stock
* 1 1/2 tablespoons of oil
* 4 tablespoons of butter
* 8 ounces of sliced mushrooms 
* 1/2 cup of finely chopped shallot
* 1/2 cup of heavy cream
* 2 tablespoons of coarse ground prepared mustard
* Salt and pepper to taste   

#### Preparation    
1. Cut vein out of kidney, separate into lobes, and liberally salt  
2. Reduce the stock to 3/4 cup
3. Slice the mushrooms
4. Chop shallot   

#### Directions   
1. Add the stock to a sauce pan and bring to a boil.
2. Maintain a boil over a medium-high heat reducing the liquid until the total volume remaining is about 3/8 of a cup and set aside.
3. Add the oil to a heavy sauté pan over high heat and bring it up to 350 degrees.  (If you do not have a infrared thermometer, drop a few popcorn kernels in the pan as it heats. Popcorn kernels pop at approximately 350 degrees.)
4. Once your pan reaches temperature, add 2 tablespoons of butter and the cleaned veal kidneys to the pan.
5. Maintain the pan over high heat and working quickly, saute the kidneys until they are uniformly colored and no red or pick is showing on the surface.  This should take no more than 3 to 4 minutes.  Remember you do not want to brown them.
6. Remove the kidneys to a strainer, discard the cooking fat and wipe out your skillet.
7. Return the sauté pan back to a high fire.
8. Add 4 tablespoons of butter and bring your pan back up to 350 degrees careful not to let your butter take on any color.
9. Add sliced mushrooms and sauté until the mushrooms let off their liquid and start to brown.
10. Lower the heat to medium and add finely chopped shallots and continue to sauté until the shallots are translucent.  Do not let them brown.
11. Add reserved stock reduction and heavy cream to the pan, bring your sauce back to a boil over medium heat.  Taste for seasoning adding salt and pepper as needed.
12. Once the sauce has reduced by about 1/4, stir in mustard and add the kidneys back to the pan.
13. Bring the kidneys and sauce back up to the boil, stir in 2 tablespoons of butter and taste again for seasoning adding salt and pepper as needed.
