### Toum (Lebanese Garlic Sauce)  

#### Ingredients  

* 1 cup (4 1/2 ounces) garlic cloves  
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt (for table salt use half as much)  
* 1/4 cup fresh juice from about 2 lemons, divided  
* 1/4 cup ice water, divided  
* 3 cups neutral oil, such as grape seed or canola, divided

#### Preparation  

* Peel and remove seed from garlic cloves  

#### Directions  

##### Food Processor Method  

* Place the de-germed garlic and kosher salt in the bowl of a food processor.  
* Pulse the garlic in short bursts, occasionally removing the lid to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a flexible rubber spatula, until finely minced.  
* Add 1 tablespoon lemon juice and continue processing until a paste begins to form.  
* Add an additional 1 tablespoon lemon juice and process until completely smooth and slightly fluffy.
* With the food processor running, slowly drizzle in 1/2 cup of oil in a very thin stream, followed by 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. 
* Repeat with another 1/2 cup of oil and the remaining 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. 
* Continue the process, alternating 1/2 cup of oil and 1 tablespoon of water until all the oil and water have been incorporated.  
* Transfer the toum to a container and store in the fridge for up to 1 month.

##### Mortar and Pestle Method  

* Depending on the size of your mortar and pestle, you may need to make the recipe in smaller batches, dividing the ingredient amounts in half or quarters.  
* In the mortar and pestle, combine the garlic and salt, grinding until it becomes a smooth paste.  
* Work oil into paste one teaspoon at a time.  
* After adding 1 tablespoon of oil, work in a few drops of lemon juice.  
* Repeat until all the oil, lemon juice, and water have been incorporated.
