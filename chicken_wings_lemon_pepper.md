### Lemon Pepper Chicken Wings  

#### Ingredients:

* Chicken wing
* 1 large lemon
* 8-10 fresh bay leaves
* 1 - 2 tablespoons whole black peppercorns (depending on how hot you want your wings)
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 teaspoons sea salt flakes (e.g. Maldon Sea Salt)
* 6 â€“ 8 garlic cloves, left whole and unpeeled

#### Preparation:

* Grind the pepper with mortar and pestle
* Juice the lemon and cut up the lemon peel into small pieces
* Preheat oven to 350F


#### Directions:

1. Add the pepper, lemon juice, salt and olive oil to a bowl. 

2. Mix, then add the chicken wings and toss until well coated. 

3. Place the wings and mixture in a baking dish. 

4. Tuck the bay leaves, lemon peel, and garlic cloves between the chicken pieces.

5. Bake for 30 minutes. 

6. Remove dish from oven and turn over chicken pieces. Bake for a further 15 to 30 minutes (depending on your oven) until the wings look well-roasted and sticky and the lemon and garlic is black on the edges. 

These wings are better overcooked.
