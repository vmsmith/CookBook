#### Preparations

#### Issues   
* Quail egg broth   
  * 5 1/2 cups of stock   
* Goose   
  * Bought at Marché Saint-Quentin   
  * Very expensive: 217€   
  * Fed six people with some leftover   
* Date Sauce   
  * Slightly sweet  
  * Not sure dates in the sauce really worked - maybe cook to add flavor, then remove dates    
* Brussels sprouts   
  * Not-so-great lots in local produce stands - next time go to *Le Grande Épicerie* 
  * Slightly undercooked - needed another minute of parboiling    
* Parsnip purée   
  * Made a day early - fine   
* Cranberry sauce   
  * Bought cranberries a week early at Rue Daguerre & made a few days in advance  
  * Fine
* Dressing   
  * Wasn't sure about the timing, but it didn't seem to matter  
  * Could have used a touch more stock    
* Roasted sweet potatoes  
  * No problems   
* Tarte tatin   
  * No cooked enough to caremalize the entire top      
* Christmas pudding      
  * Underestimated the time to re-stream
