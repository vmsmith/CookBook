### Moroccan Lentils  

#### Ingredients  

* 2 cups brown lentils  
* 4 tablespoon of olive oil  
* 1 large tomato, chopped  
* 1 medium onion, chopped  
* 3 to 5 cloves of garlic, finely chopped  
* 4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley and cilantro  
* 2 1/2 teaspoons cumin  
* 2 1/2 teaspoons paprika  
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ginger  
* 1/2 teaspoon pepper  
* 2 teaspoons salt, or to taste  

#### Preparation  

* Peel, seed, and chop tomato  
* Chop onion  
* Chop garlic  
* Chop parsley and cilantro  

#### Directions  

1. Mix all the ingredients except lentils in a Dutch oven (or similar) and cook over a medium heat for 5 - 10 minutes.

2. Add the lentils and 2 liters of water, and bring to a simmer. 

3. Cover, and cook on pressure over medium heat for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the lentils are tender. 

4. If the lentils are still submerged in sauce, you must reduce the liquids so that the sauce is ample, but not watery. 

5. Adjust the seasoning if desired, and serve.
