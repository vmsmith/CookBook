### Red Wine Reduction Sauce  

#### Ingredients  
* 1 tablespoon olive oil    
* 1 small shallot, minced    
* 1 garlic clove, minced    
* 1 cup dry red wine    
* 1 cup stock   
* 1 sprig fresh thyme    
* 1 sprig fresh rosemary    
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature    
* Kosher salt to taste    
* Black pepper to taste   

#### Preparation  
1. Mince the shallot
2. Mince the garlic   

#### Directions  
1. Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat.
2. Add the minced shallot and cook for 2 minutes, then add the garlic and cook for an additional 2 minutes.
3. Add the red wine and turn the heat up to medium-high heat or high heat and bring the mixture to a boil.
4. Boil the mixture until it reduces to 1/3 of its original volume, about 5–7 minutes, but keep an eye on it to avoid any burning.
5. After the wine reduces, add the stock, sprigs of thyme, and rosemary.
6. Keep the mixture at a boil and continue to reduce it until the sauce is thick and syrup-like, about 5–7 minutes.
7. Turn the heat down to low heat and whisk in the 2 tablespoons of butter **at room temperature**.   
8. Strain the sauce to remove the bits of garlic, shallot, and herbs.
9. Taste the sauce to adjust the seasoning at this point and add salt and pepper to taste.
