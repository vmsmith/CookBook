### Figs and Raspberries with Steeped Lemon Cream  

From [Gabrielle Hamilton - "Prune"](https://www.wnyc.org/story/recipe-gabrielle-hamiltons-figs-and-raspberries-steeped-lemon-cream/)  
Yield: 6 servings

#### Ingredients  

* 2 cups of heavy cream
* Zest of 2 small lemons, without pith, taken in long spirals as possible
* 2 1/2 tablespoons of sugar
* 2 pints of figsâ€”fresh, perfect
* 1 pint of raspberries, also fresh and perfect

#### Preparations  

1. Grind lemon peels with sugar in clean, pastry-only spice grinder until wet, oily sand consistency.
2. Put mixture in quart container and pour in heavy cream. Shake very well to dissolve sugar.
3. Steep 1 full day.  
4. Shake well before using, at each use. Keep very cold.

#### Directions  

1. Cut ripe black figs open to reveal hopefully jammy, perfect, red interiors and arrange in shallow small bowl.  
2. Stud ripe red raspberries in and around the figs, or in a mound in center.  
3. Shake lemon-sweetened cream in quart container and pour through small passoir to strain out bits of zest, letting cream pool up in and around fruit without drowning it completely.
4. Make sure fruit is room temperature and cream is cold.
