### Garlic Shrimp with Peas  




Makes 6 servings

1½ pounds medium shrimp with shells, shelled and deveined; retain shells

Salt to taste

1½ pounds fresh English peas, shelled (1¼ to 1½ cups depending on size)


3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

1 head green garlic or 6 garlic cloves, minced

¼ to ½ teaspoon red chili flakes, to taste

1/3 cup finely chopped cilantro

1/3 cup finely chopped parsley

Cooked rice for serving, optional


1. Place shrimp shells in a medium saucepan, add 1 quart water and salt to taste. Bring to a boil. Skim off foam, reduce heat, cover partly and simmer 30 minutes. Strain broth into a bowl and discard shells. Return broth to saucepan.

2. Meanwhile, sprinkle shrimp with salt, toss and let sit for 15 minutes.

3. Return broth to a boil and add peas. Boil two minutes, until just wrinkled and slightly tender. Scoop out with a skimmer or slotted spoon and set aside. Measure out ½ cup broth and set aside.

4. Heat oil over medium heat in a wide heavy skillet. Add garlic and chili flakes. Cook, stirring, until garlic is fragrant and beginning to color, about one minute. Turn heat to medium-high and add shrimp. Cook, stirring, until shrimp turns pink, about two minutes. Add peas, cilantro and parsley and continue to toss in the pan for another minute. Stir in ½ cup broth and heat through while stirring to deglaze pan. Remove from heat, taste and adjust seasoning. Serve.
