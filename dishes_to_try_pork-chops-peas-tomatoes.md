* 2 tablespoons butter (optional)
* 1/2 pint cherry tomatoes, halved

* 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper, optional

* Juice of 1/2 lemon
* 1/4 cup heavy cream

#### Preparations   


#### Directions  

Prepare the Pork Chops:
Preheat oven to 400ºF. Pat the pork chops dry and season all over with salt and pepper. In a wide ovenproof skillet or sauté pan, heat the neutral cooking oil over medium-high heat. Once very hot, add the pork chops and cook for 3 minutes until very well-browned and crisping up around the edges. Flip and cook an additional 2-3 minutes.
Transfer to the oven for 10-12 minutes or until the pork chops reach 140ºF. Remove from the oven and cover loosely with foil to rest as you finish the rest of the recipe.
Fry the Aromatics:
Return the same pan to medium heat. Add the yellow onion and cook for 5-7 minutes or until it begins to soften. Next, Add the garlic and cook for 45 seconds or until fragrant. Then, add the butter. Once the butter is melted and frothy, add the tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes. Season everything in the pan with salt and pepper.
Cook the Creamy Peas and Tomatoes:
Pour the chicken stock into the pan and scrape up any browned bits stuck tot he bottom of the pan. Add the peas and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5-6 minutes or until the peas are softened but still bright green.
Return the heat to medium (a very low boil). Season to taste with salt and pepper and then add the crushed red pepper, and thyme.
Pour in the heavy cream and the lemon juice. Cook for 5 additional minutes or until the sauce has thickened a bit. Turn off the heat.
To Serve the Pork Chops with Creamy Peas and Tomatoes:
If desired, thinly slice the pork chops. Divide the creamy peas and tomatoes between bowls and arrange the sliced pork on top. Pour more of the cream sauce over the pork chops just before serving. Sprinkle with a touch of finishing salt, if desired. Enjoy!
