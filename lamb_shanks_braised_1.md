### Braised Lamb Shanks  

#### Ingredients

* Lamb shanks
* Salt and fresh-ground black pepper
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 1 - 2 medium carrots, chopped
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* Garlic cloves, chopped
* 1 cup red Rioja wine
* 1 cup lamb stock
 
#### Preparation

1. Preheat oven to 350F
2. Remove excess fat and silver skin from lamb shanks
3. Chop the carrots and onions
4. Chop the garlic clove

#### Directions

1. In a braising pan, heat the oil over high heat. 

2. Salt and pepper the lamb shanks, then add and cook then for 5 to 6 minutes, turning, until they are browned. Lift the meat from the pan, and set them aside. 

3. Add the carrots, onions, and garlic, and cook them over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, until the onions are lightly browned. 

4. Reduce the heat, and cook the vegetables over low heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. 

5. Add the lamb shanks, wine, and lamb stock. Add salt and pepper, and perhaps some rosemary and a bay leaf. Eventually think about some sort of tomatoes.

6. **Get it simmering on the stove for a few minutes.**  

7. Do the parchment paper thing, cover tightly with lid, then put in the oven. 

8. Turn the lamb shanks every 30 minutes. If the liquid is simmering to hard, reduce the heat a bit.

9. Cook for about 2 1/2 hours.

10. Remove the lamb from the pan, and set it aside. Remove the bay leaf and rosemary stems. Pur√©e the remaining ingredients with the immersion blender.
