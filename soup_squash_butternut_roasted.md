### Roasted Butternut Squash and Sage Soup  

#### Ingredients  

* 1 large butternut squash (3 pounds), cut in half and seeded      
* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil    
* 1 medium yellow or white onion (6 ounces), chopped    
* 1 medium clove garlic, peeled and chopped    
* 1/2 cup loosely packed sage leaves (1/2 ounce), finely chopped and divided    
* 4 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth
* Creme fraiche   
* Salt   

#### Preparation  

1. Preheat oven to 350F  
2. Line oven pan with parchement paper  
3. Half and seed the squash, and prick the skin with a fork    
4. Chop the onion
5. Peel and chop the garlic   

#### Directions  
1. Put the squash halves face down on the parchement paper, and roast for 1 hour, or until the skin has softened and a knife inserted in the flesh goes in easily. Let cool slightly.
2. When it's done, scrape out the roasted squash.  
3. Heat the oil until simmering, then add the onion and cook until it softens.
4. Add the garlic and stir for a minute or so.
5. Add half of the sage, reserving the rest for garnish, and cook until aromatic, a few minutes.
6. Add the roasted squash and broth.
7. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil, then reduce to medium-low or just enough so the liquid is gently simmering, cover and cook, stirring once or twice, to bring all the flavors together, about 10 minutes.
8. Remove the soup from the heat and let cool a bit.
9. Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth.
10. Season to taste with salt.
11. Serve hot, and add a dollop of creme fraiche. ..
