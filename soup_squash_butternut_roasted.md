### Roasted Butternut Squash Soup  

#### Ingredients  

* 1 large butternut squash (about 3 pounds), halved vertically and seeds removed  
* 1/2 cup of chopped shallot   
* 4 garlic cloves, minced  
* 1 teaspoon maple syrup  
* 3 to 4 cups vegetable broth, as needed  
* 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for drizzling  
* 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg  
* 1 teaspoon salt  
* Freshly ground black pepper, to taste  
* 1 to 2 tablespoons butter, to taste  

#### Preparation  

1. Preheat oven to 425F  
2. Line oven pan with parchement paper  
3. Half and seed the squash  
4. Chop shallots  

#### Directions  

1. Rub some oil over the inside of the squash and sprinkle it with salt and pepper  
2. Turn the squash face down on the parchement paper and roast until it is tender and completely cooked through, about 40 to 50 minutes  
3. Set aside until it is cool enough to handle, then scoop out the flesh and set aside    
4. Warm 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat until shimmering and add the chopped shallot and 1 teaspoon salt   
5. Cook, stirring often, until the shallot has softened and is starting to turn golden on the edges, about 3 to 4 minutes   
6. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute, stirring frequently   
7. Add the maple syrup, nutmeg and a few twists of freshly ground black pepper to the blender   
8. Pour in 3 cups vegetable broth, add the squash, and blend  
9. Stop once your soup is ultra creamy  
10. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons butter to taste, and blend well. Taste and stir in more salt and pepper, if necessary.

#### Note: Safely Cutting Squash   
* Place a lightly damp tea towel beneath your cutting board to keep it from moving around
* Cut off the tip-top and very bottom ends of the squash   
* Stand the squash upright with the thickest flat side as the base   
* Carefully slice through it from top to bottom to divide it in half (keeping fingers out of harm's way)   
* Use a large spoon to scoop out the seeds and discard them
