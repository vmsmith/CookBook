### Mushroom Soup  

#### Ingredients  

* 4 cups of chicken stock  
* 20 ounces of sliced, mixed mushrooms (button, oyster, shitaki, Portabello, crimini, etc.) 
* 1 medium onion, sliced thinly  
* 6 tablespoons of butter  
* A parsley sprig  
* 2 ounces of high-quality, medium-bodied sherry  
* A little cream  (optional)  
* Piment d'Esplette (optional)

#### Preparation   

* Slice the mushrooms  
* Slice the onions  
* Preheat the chicken stock  


#### Directions  

1. Melt two tablespoons of butter over medium heat.

2. Add the sliced onions and cook until the onions are soft and translucent.

3. Add the remaining butter and the mushrooms; salt and pepper.

4. Let the mixture sweat for about eight minutes, taking care the onions don’t brown.

5. Stir in the hot chicken stock and the parsley.

6. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for an hour.

7. Remove from the heat and let cool a bit.

8. Blend with an immersion blender (or in a stand-up blender).

9. Return the mixture to the pot, bring it to a simmer, add the sherry, and season with salt and pepper as necessary.

10. A tablespoon or two of heavy cream, or a dash of piment d’Esplette, or both, will add an additional layer if desired.

At this point it can be cooled and put in the refrigerator overnight to let the flavors marry.
