### Mushroom Soup  

#### Ingredients  

* 4 cups of chicken stock  
* 20 ounces of sliced, mixed mushrooms (button, oyster, shitaki, Portabello, crimini, etc.) 
* 1 medium onion, sliced thinly  
* 6 tablespoons of butter  
* A parsley sprig  
* 2 ounces of high-quality, medium-bodied sherry  
* A little cream  (optional)  
* Piment d'Esplette (optional)

#### Preparation   

* Slice the mushrooms  
* Slice the onions  
* Preheat the chicken stock  


#### Directions   
1. Melt two tablespoons of butter over medium heat.
2. Add the sliced onions and cook until the onions are soft and translucent.
3. Add the remaining butter and the mushrooms; salt and pepper.
4. Let the mixture sweat for about eight minutes, taking care the onions don’t brown.
5. Stir in the hot chicken stock and the parsley.
6. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for an hour.
7. Remove from the heat and let cool a bit.
8. Blend with an immersion blender (or in a stand-up blender).
9. Return the mixture to the pot, bring it to a simmer, add the sherry, and season with salt and pepper as necessary.
10. A tablespoon or two of heavy cream, or a dash of piment d’Esplette, or both, will add an additional layer if desired.

At this point it can be cooled and put in the refrigerator overnight to let the flavors marry.

#### Garnish    
1. Sautéed Mushroom Slices: Thinly slice a few mushrooms (like shiitake or cremini), sauté them in butter or olive oil until golden and slightly crispy, and place them on top for added texture and visual appeal.
2. Fresh Herbs: Chopped Parsley: Adds a fresh, bright flavor. Thyme Leaves: Earthy and aromatic, perfect for mushroom-based dishes. Chives: A mild onion flavor that complements the richness of the soup.   
3. Crème Fraîche or Sour Cream:  A dollop of crème fraîche, sour cream, or plain yogurt swirled into the soup just before serving adds creaminess and a slight tang.   
4. Truffle Oil Drizzle: A small drizzle of truffle oil enhances the earthy mushroom flavors and adds a luxurious touch.   
5. Crispy Shallots: Thinly slice shallots, fry them until crispy, and sprinkle on top for crunch and a savory-sweet accent.   
6. Toasted Nuts: Crushed hazelnuts, pine nuts, or walnuts add a nutty flavor and a bit of crunch.   
7. Microgreens: A small handful of microgreens (such as arugula or pea shoots) brings freshness and a peppery bite.   
8. Croutons: Small, crispy croutons provide a satisfying crunch. Try making garlic- or herb-infused croutons for added flavor.   
9. Parmesan Shavings: A few thin shavings of Parmesan cheese lend a salty, umami-rich note that pairs beautifully with mushrooms.   
10. Infused Oil: Drizzle a small amount of herb-infused oil (like thyme- or rosemary-infused olive oil) for extra fragrance and flavor.   

Combination Ideas:
Sautéed mushroom slices + a drizzle of truffle oil.
Crispy shallots + fresh thyme leaves.
Crème fraîche + toasted nuts.
