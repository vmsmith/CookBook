Pickling red onions is quite simple and can be done with just a few ingredients. Here's a basic recipe:

Ingredients:
- 1 large red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 cup white vinegar or apple cider vinegar
- 1 cup water
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon salt
- Optional: whole spices such as peppercorns, mustard seeds, or bay leaves for added flavor

Instructions:
1. Peel the red onion and slice it thinly. You can use a sharp knife or a mandoline slicer for even slices.
2. In a small saucepan, combine the vinegar, water, sugar, salt, and any optional spices you'd like to use. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar and salt are completely dissolved. This is your pickling liquid.
3. Place the sliced red onion in a clean glass jar or container with a tight-fitting lid.
4. Once the pickling liquid is ready, carefully pour it over the sliced onions in the jar, making sure the onions are completely submerged. If necessary, use a spoon to press down on the onions to ensure they are covered by the liquid.
5. Let the pickled onions cool to room temperature, then cover the jar with a lid and refrigerate it. Allow the onions to pickle for at least 1 hour before using them, but for best results, let them pickle for at least a few hours or overnight to develop their flavor.
6. Use the pickled red onions as a topping for salads, sandwiches, tacos, burgers, or any other dish where you want a tangy and flavorful garnish.

Pickled red onions can be stored in the refrigerator for several weeks, although they are best when consumed within a few weeks for optimal flavor and texture.
