### Sweetbreads  

#### Preparation  

1. Soak in milk for a few hours (overnight is fine), or in water with a splash of vinegar or lemon juice   

2. Put soaked sweetbreads into boiling water, bring back to a boil, turn heat down, and simmer for 5 minutes  

3. Remove and put into the ice water to cool down rapidly

4. When cold, remove from water and carefully peel off the membrane that surrounds the sweetbread  

5. Optional: Compress it for about 20 if it's going to get sliced  

#### Poached with Macédoine  

A. Prep peas, carrots, beans, potatoes, and turnips    

1. Poach in salted chicken stock for 30 minutes  

2. Make [macédoine](https://github.com/vmsmith/CookBook/blob/master/veg_macedoine.md) while sweetbreads are poaching  

3. Serve with [macédoine](https://github.com/vmsmith/CookBook/blob/master/veg_macedoine.md) as a main course  

#### Sautéed and Broiled with Duxelles  

A. Make [duxelles]()  

1. Remove the sweetbread from the plate, pat dry, slice into scallops, season lightly with salt and pepper

2. In a small skillet, melt some butter over low heat and add the scallops of sweetbread into the butter

3. Cook gently until just lightly golden on the underside, flip and do the same for the other side

4. Drain off the excess butter and top each scallop of sweetbreads with a coating of the duxelles and then a scattering of breadcrumbs

5. Quarter the extra mushrooms and put around the sweetbreads  

6. Put the whole thing under broiler and broil until the breadcrumbs are golden brown and the quartered mushrooms are just lightly cooked  

7. Serve with a squeeze of lemon juice and some chopped parsley
