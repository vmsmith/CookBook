### Slow Cooked Whole Chicken    
( [NY Times](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1024994-slow-cooker-whole-chicken) )

#### Ingredients    
* 1 whole (4- to 5-pound) chicken, trimmed of excess fat     
* 6 large garlic cloves, peeled     
* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the pot     
* 1 large onion (any variety), cut into ¼-inch slices     
* 1 large carrot, peeled and quartered lengthwise     
* 2 teaspoons smoked paprika     
* 1 teaspoon ground turmeric    
* Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper

#### Preparation     
1. Cut the onion.   
2. Cur the carrot.   
3. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and season it generously all over (inside the cavity as well) with 5 to 7 teaspoons of salt, depending on the weight of your bird, and about 2 teaspoons of pepper. (If the chicken is smaller than 4 pounds, reduce salt to 3½ to 4 teaspoons. This can be done up to 24 hours in advance and the chicken kept in the refrigerator, uncovered. Take the chicken out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking.
4. Preheat the oven to 300F. 

#### Directions   
1. Place half of the garlic cloves inside the cavity of the chicken.
2. Arrange the onion slices in a single layer on the bottom of the Dutch oven.
3. Place the carrot sticks on top to create a rack for the chicken to rest on.
4. Place the chicken on top of the carrot sticks.
5. Drizzle 1/4 cup of water around the sides of the chicken.
6. Sprinkle the paprika and turmeric all over the top and sides of the chicken, including the nooks and crannies of the wings and the legs.
7. Scatter the remaining garlic around the sides.
8. Cover and cook for 2 1/2 or 3 hours, until cooked through and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thick part of the thigh reads 155 to 165 degrees.
