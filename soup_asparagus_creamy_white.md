### Creamy White Asparagus Soup   

#### Ingredients   
* 1/4 cup coarsely chopped onion
* 1 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1 pounds white asparagus, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces, tips reserved
* 3 cups chicken or vegetable stock   
* 1/4 cup half-and-half
* Salt, to taste
* Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
* Dry white wine, to taste
* Finely chopped fresh parsley, for garnish

#### Preparation   
1. Chop onion   
2. Peel and cut asparagus (reserve tips)  
3. Chop parsley   

#### Directions   

1. Saut√© the onion in butter until it is soft and translucent.    
2. Add the pieces of asparagus (minus the tips), cover, and steam for 5 minutes.    
3. Add the stock and boil gently for about 30 minutes or until the asparagus is very soft.    
4. Puree the soup in batches in the blender (place a towel over the lid and hold down the lid, so the hot soup does not splatter) or with a hand blender until smooth.   
5. Return the soup to the pan. Bring the soup to a simmer and add the reserved asparagus tips.   
6. Cook at least 5 minutes or until the asparagus tips are fork-tender.   
7. Turn down the heat and add the half-and-half, stirring often, until warmed through. **Do not boil.**       
8. Season to taste.   
9. Stir in a few spoonfuls of white wine if you think the soup needs acidity.   
10. Garnish with parsley, and serve.
