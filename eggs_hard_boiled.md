### Hard Boiled Eggs   

#### Ingredients   
* Eggs   


#### Preparation   
1. Bring the eggs to room temperature  

#### Directions   
* Put eggs in a pot, and cover with an inch of water.
* Bring the water to a boil (uncovered pot).
* Take the pot off the heat, and let the eggs sit in it for:
  * 6 minutes - soft eggs, with set whites and yolks that are loose, but not runny (jammy)      
  * 8 minutes - whites that are still pliable, and yolks that are mostly set, with some jamminess in the centre.
* Run the eggs under cold water, or transfer them to ice water.
