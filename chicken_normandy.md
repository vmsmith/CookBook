* 1 cup good-quality hard apple cider    
* 1/2 cup of Creme Fraiche    
* 2 teaspoons of olive oil    
* 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter

2. Brown the chicken pieces (2 to 3 minutes per side( then transfer to a plate.
3. Remove the pot and let cool slightly.
4. Return pot to medium-low heat, and add the leeks.
5. Cook, stirring frequently, until leeks begin to soften and are pale golden, about 3 minutes.
6. Add hard cider and thyme.
7. Move leeks to edges of pot, and add all the chicken pieces to pot, skin sides down.
8. Arrange leeks over chicken.
9. Cover, and cook 15 minutes (if liquid is bubbling rapidly, reduce heat to low).

### Chicken Normandy #2

#### Ingredients

* 4 chicken thighs, skin on, bone in
* 3 tablespoons of butter or fowl fat
* 1/2 cup of Calvados
* 1 1/4 cups of hard cider
* 15 pearl onions
* 1 1/2 pounds of honeycrisp apples
* 2 tablespoons of cornstarch (or roux)
* 5 tablespoons of crème fraiche

#### Preparation

1. Pat the chicken very dry with paper towels, and season well with salt and pepper.


#### Directions

1. Heat the fat in a large Dutch oven or deep skillet over medium-high until shimmering. 

2. Brown the chicken, in batches if necessary, skin side down until deep golden, 6 to 8 minutes, then flip, and sear the other side until golden, another 3 minutes. 

3. Once the chicken is browned, turn off the heat, and add the Calvados. When the sizzling subsides, turn the heat on to medium low, bring the liquid to a simmer and cook for 4 minutes to evaporate the alcohol. 

4. Add the cider and onions, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Turn the heat down to a very gentle simmer. 

5. Quickly peel and core the apples, and cut them into 1 1/2-inch chunks, and place them on top of the chicken. 

6. Cover the pan, and cook, checking occasionally to ensure the liquid is maintaining a gentle simmer, not boiling, until the chicken is just cooked through, 35-40 minutes. 

7. Remove the chicken, onions and apples to a platter, and cover. 

8. Make a slurry with the cornstarch and 3 tablespoons of cold water. Stir this into the braising liquid, and bring to a simmer for 1 minute, until thickened. 

9. Stir in the crème fraîche, and season the sauce with salt to taste, replace the chicken, onions and apples in the sauce and serve with crusty bread and a salad.
